# Story 2.3: Generate `.roomodes` File

**Status:** Draft

## Goal & Context

**User Story:** As a Developer using the interactive mode, after selecting modes, I want the CLI to create or update a `.roomodes` file in my target project directory containing the definitions of the selected modes.

**Context:** This story follows the interactive mode trigger (Story 2.1) and mode selection (Story 2.2). It implements the crucial step of generating the `.roomodes` file in the target project directory. This file serves as the central configuration for the selected modes. The story also incorporates the `--force` flag from Story 2.1 to handle potential overwrite conflicts. This is a key part of Epic 2's goal to deliver the complete interactive MVP workflow ([`docs/epic2.md`](docs/epic2.md:3)).

## Detailed Requirements

- Identify the target project directory (defaults to the current working directory, but may need future configuration).
- Retrieve the full `ModeDefinition` objects for the modes selected in Story 2.2.
- Format the selected mode definitions into the specified JSON structure for `.roomodes`.
- Write the JSON content to a file named `.roomodes` in the root of the target project directory.
- Before writing, check if `.roomodes` already exists.
- If it exists and the `--force` flag (from Story 2.1) was *not* provided, report an error and halt.
- If it exists and `--force` *was* provided, overwrite the file.
- If it does not exist, create it.

## Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

- AC1: After mode selection, a `.roomodes` file is created in the target directory if it doesn't exist.
- AC2: The content of the created `.roomodes` file is valid JSON.
- AC3: The JSON structure contains an array of `ModeDefinition` objects corresponding exactly to the selected modes.
- AC4: If `.roomodes` exists and `--force` is not used, the command fails with an error message indicating the conflict.
- AC5: If `.roomodes` exists and `--force` is used, its content is replaced with the new JSON based on the current selection.

## Technical Implementation Context

**Guidance:** Use the following details for implementation. Developer agent is expected to follow project standards in [`docs/coding-standards.md`](docs/coding-standards.md:0) and understand the project structure in [`docs/project-structure.md`](docs/project-structure.md:0). Only story-specific details are included below.

- **Relevant Files:**

  - Files to Create:
    - [`src/core/FileManager.ts`](src/core/FileManager.ts:0): Implement the class responsible for file system operations, including writing the `.roomodes` file.
  - Files to Modify:
    - [`src/cli.ts`](src/cli.ts:0) or [`src/commands/init.ts`](src/commands/init.ts:0): Instantiate `FileManager` and call its method to write the `.roomodes` file after mode selection. Pass the list of selected modes and the state of the `--force` flag.
    - [`src/types/domain.ts`](src/types/domain.ts:0): Ensure the `ModeDefinition` interface is correctly defined based on [`docs/data-models.md`](docs/data-models.md:0).
    - [`src/utils/errorHandler.ts`](src/utils/errorHandler.ts:0): Implement or utilize error handling for file system issues and overwrite conflicts.
    - [`src/utils/uiManager.ts`](src/utils/uiManager.ts:0): Utilize for displaying progress indicators and success/error messages.

- **Key Technologies:**

  - Node.js (`^20.12.0`)
  - TypeScript (`^5.4.5`)
  - pnpm (`^9.1.0`)
  - `fs-extra` (`^11.2.0` as per [`docs/tech-stack.md`](docs/tech-stack.md:46)): Used for file system operations (`ensureDir`, `writeJson`, `pathExists`).
  - `DefinitionLoader` (from Story 1.3): Provides access to full mode definitions.
  - `ModeSelector` (from Story 2.2): Provides the list of selected mode slugs.

- **API Interactions / SDK Usage:**

  - Use `fs-extra.pathExists` to check for file existence.
  - Use `fs-extra.writeJson` to write the JSON content to `.roomodes`.

- **UI/UX Notes:**

  - Provide a progress indicator (e.g., using `ora` via `UiManager`) while writing the file.
  - Display a clear success message upon successful file creation/update.
  - Display a clear error message if an overwrite conflict occurs without `--force`.

- **Data Structures:**

  - Utilize the `ModeDefinition` interface from [`src/types/domain.ts`](src/types/domain.ts:0).
  - The structure of the `.roomodes` file should match the specification in [`docs/data-models.md`](docs/data-models.md:122).

- **Environment Variables:**

  - None required for this story ([`docs/environment-vars.md`](docs/environment-vars.md:7)).

- **Coding Standards Notes:**

  - Follow standards defined in [`docs/coding-standards.md`](docs/coding-standards.md:0).
  - Ensure `FileManager` is designed to be injectable ([`docs/architecture.md:170`](docs/architecture.md:170)).
  - Use `async`/`await` for handling asynchronous file system operations ([`docs/coding-standards.md:50`](docs/coding-standards.md:50)).
  - Use JSDoc comments for the `FileManager` class and its methods.

## Testing Requirements

**Guidance:** Verify implementation against the ACs using the following tests. Follow general testing approach in [`docs/testing-strategy.md`](docs/testing-strategy.md:0).

- **Unit Tests:**
    - Test `FileManager`'s logic for formatting the `.roomodes` JSON content based on a list of `ModeDefinition` objects.
    - Test `FileManager`'s logic for checking file existence and respecting the `--force` flag when writing `.roomodes`.
    - Use Vitest mocks (`vi.mock('fs-extra')`) to simulate file system interactions.
- **Integration Tests:**
    - Test the integration between the command handler (`src/cli.ts` or `src/commands/init.ts`), `ModeSelector` (providing selected modes), and `FileManager` (writing the file). Use temporary directories for realistic file system interaction testing (as per [`docs/testing-strategy.md`](docs/testing-strategy.md:52)).
    - Test scenarios with and without existing `.roomodes` file and with and without the `--force` flag (AC1, AC4, AC5).
- **Manual/CLI Verification:**
    - Run `pnpm install`.
    - Run `pnpm run build`.
    - Run `roo-init`, select modes, and verify that `.roomodes` is created with the correct content (AC1, AC2, AC3).
    - Run `roo-init` again in the same directory without `--force` and verify that it fails with an overwrite error (AC4).
    - Run `roo-init --force` in the same directory and verify that `.roomodes` is overwritten (AC5).
