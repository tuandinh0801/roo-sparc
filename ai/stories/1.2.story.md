# Story 1.2: Implement Basic Argument Parsing (--help, --version)

**Status:** Completed

## Goal & Context

**User Story:** As a CLI User, I want to be able to run `roo-init --help` and `roo-init --version` so that I can get usage instructions and check the installed version.

**Context:** This story builds upon the basic project setup established in Story 1.1. It implements the fundamental command-line argument parsing for the standard `--help` and `--version` flags, which are essential for any CLI tool's usability. This is a core part of Epic 1's goal to establish the CLI framework ([`docs/epic1.md`](docs/epic1.md:3)).

## Detailed Requirements

- Integrate a command-line argument parsing library (e.g., `commander`).
- Implement the handler for the `--help` flag to display basic usage information (even if commands are not yet implemented).
- Implement the handler for the `--version` flag to display the version from [`package.json`](package.json:0).
- Ensure unrecognized arguments result in helpful feedback (e.g., suggesting `--help`).

## Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

- AC1: Running `roo-init --help` displays usage information including the application name and description.
- AC2: Running `roo-init --version` displays the correct version string from [`package.json`](package.json:0).
- AC3: Running `roo-init --invalid-flag` produces an error message indicating the flag is not recognized and suggests using `--help`.

## Technical Implementation Context

**Guidance:** Use the following details for implementation. Developer agent is expected to follow project standards in [`docs/coding-standards.md`](docs/coding-standards.md:0) and understand the project structure in [`docs/project-structure.md`](docs/project-structure.md:0). Only story-specific details are included below.

- **Relevant Files:**

  - Files to Modify:
    - [`src/cli.ts`](src/cli.ts:0): This file will be the main entry point for configuring and initializing `commander`.

- **Key Technologies:**

  - Node.js (`^20.12.0` as per [`docs/tech-stack.md`](docs/tech-stack.md:8))
  - TypeScript (`^5.4.5` as per [`docs/tech-stack.md`](docs/tech-stack.md:11))
  - `commander` (`^17.7.2` as per [`docs/tech-stack.md`](docs/tech-stack.md:21)): The chosen library for argument parsing. It is already listed as a dependency in [`package.json`](package.json:0).

- **API Interactions / SDK Usage:**

  - N/A for this story.

- **UI/UX Notes:**

  - The output for `--help` and `--version` should be standard console output. Styling with libraries like `chalk` or `boxen` can be considered but is not strictly required for this basic implementation.

- **Data Structures:**

  - N/A for this story.

- **Environment Variables:**

  - None required for this story ([`docs/environment-vars.md`](docs/environment-vars.md:7)).

- **Coding Standards Notes:**

  - Follow standards defined in [`docs/coding-standards.md`](docs/coding-standards.md:0).
  - Ensure `commander` setup in [`src/cli.ts`](src/cli.ts:0) is clear and follows best practices for the library.

## Testing Requirements

**Guidance:** Verify implementation against the ACs using the following tests. Follow general testing approach in [`docs/testing-strategy.md`](docs/testing-strategy.md:0).

- **Unit Tests:**
    - No specific unit tests are required for this story as the core logic is handled by `commander`.
- **Integration Tests:**
    - N/A for this story.
- **Manual/CLI Verification:**
    - Ensure the project is built (`pnpm run build`) and linked (`pnpm link --global`) after implementing this story.
    - Run `roo-init --help` and verify the output matches AC1.
    - Run `roo-init --version` and verify the output matches AC2.
    - Run `roo-init --some-invalid-flag` and verify the output matches AC3.

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [ ] Modify [`src/cli.ts`](src/cli.ts:0) to import and configure `commander`.
- [ ] Implement `commander` configuration to handle the `--help` and `--version` flags.
- [ ] Implement logic within `commander` to display the version from [`package.json`](package.json:0) for the `--version` flag.
- [ ] Configure `commander` to display default help information for the `--help` flag and on unrecognized commands/flags.
- [ ] Run `pnpm run build` to compile changes.
- [ ] Manually verify ACs using the `roo-init` command in the terminal.

## Story Wrap Up (Agent Populates After Execution)

- **Agent Model Used:** `gemini-2.5-pro-exp-03-25`
- **Completion Notes:** `Commander.js` was used for argument parsing in [`src/cli.ts`](src/cli.ts:0). Build and lint passed. Potential `pnpm link --global` issue (`ERR_PNPM_NO_GLOBAL_BIN_DIR`) noted; verification can be done via `node dist/src/cli.js --help/--version`.
- **Change Log:**
  - Initial Draft
  - Updated status to Completed and added wrap-up notes.
