# Story 4.8: Implement `delete custom category` Command

**Status:** Draft

## Goal & Context

**User Story:** As a CLI User, I want a command `roo-init manage delete category <slug>` to remove a custom category, so I can clean up my personalized configurations.

**Context:** This story completes the CRUD lifecycle for custom categories by implementing the "Delete" functionality. Users will be able to remove custom categories they no longer need. This involves removing the category definition from `~/.config/roo-init/user-definitions.json` and also updating any custom modes that might reference the deleted category.

## Detailed Requirements

- Create the `roo-init manage delete category <slug>` command. The `<slug>` argument is mandatory.
- Load the `user-definitions.json` file.
- Check if a custom category with the given `<slug>` exists in the `customCategories` array.
    - If not found, display an error message (e.g., "Custom category with slug '<slug>' not found.") and exit.
    - If the slug corresponds to a system category, an error like "System categories cannot be deleted. You can only delete categories you created." should be shown.
- If the custom category is found, prompt the user for confirmation before deletion (e.g., "Are you sure you want to delete custom category '<slug>'? This will also remove it from any custom modes that reference it. (y/N)").
- If confirmed:
    - Remove the category definition object from the `customCategories` array in `user-definitions.json`.
    - Iterate through all custom modes in the `customModes` array:
        - For each custom mode, check its `categorySlugs` array.
        - If the deleted category's slug is present, remove it from that mode's `categorySlugs` array.
    - Save the updated `user-definitions.json` (with the category removed and modes' `categorySlugs` updated).
    - Provide clear feedback of successful deletion.
- If not confirmed, exit gracefully with a message like "Deletion cancelled."

## Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

- AC1: User is prompted for confirmation before deleting a specified custom category, and the prompt warns about removing it from referencing modes.
- AC2: If confirmed, the specified custom category definition is removed from the `customCategories` array in `~/.config/roo-init/user-definitions.json`.
- AC3: If confirmed, the slug of the deleted category is removed from the `categorySlugs` array of all custom modes that were referencing it in `user-definitions.json`.
- AC4: Attempting to delete a non-existent custom category slug results in an error message.
- AC5: Attempting to delete a slug that only exists as a system category results in an error message indicating system categories cannot be deleted.
- AC6: If deletion is not confirmed by the user, no changes are made, and a cancellation message is shown.
- AC7: Successful deletion is confirmed with a message.

## Technical Implementation Context

**Guidance:** Use the following details for implementation. Developer agent is expected to follow project standards in [`docs/coding-standards.md`](docs/coding-standards.md:0) and understand the project structure in [`docs/project-structure.md`](docs/project-structure.md:0). Only story-specific details are included below.

- **Relevant Files:**
    - Files to Create:
        - `src/commands/manageDeleteCategory.ts`
        - `tests/commands/manageDeleteCategory.test.ts`
    - Files to Modify:
        - [`src/cli.ts`](src/cli.ts:0): Register the new command.
        - [`src/core/FileManager.ts`](src/core/FileManager.ts:0): Method to update `user-definitions.json` (remove a category and update referencing modes).
        - [`src/utils/uiManager.ts`](src/utils/uiManager.ts:0): For `inquirer` confirmation prompt.
        - [`src/core/DefinitionLoader.ts`](src/core/DefinitionLoader.ts:0): To distinguish system vs. custom categories for validation.
- **Key Technologies:**
    - `commander`: For command and argument parsing.
    - `inquirer`: For confirmation prompt.
    - `fs-extra`: For updating `user-definitions.json`.
- **API Interactions / SDK Usage:**
    - `DefinitionLoader.getCustomDefinitions()` or `FileManager.readUserDefinitions()`: To find the category and referencing modes.
    - `FileManager.writeUserDefinitions()`: To save updated `user-definitions.json`.
    - `inquirer.prompt()`.
- **UI/UX Notes:**
    - The confirmation prompt should clearly state the consequence of removing the category from modes.
- **Data Structures:**
    - `CategoryDefinition`, `ModeDefinition` from [`docs/data-models.md`](docs/data-models.md:0).
- **Environment Variables:**
    - None.
- **Coding Standards Notes:**
    - Careful manipulation of the `customModes` and `customCategories` arrays is needed.

## Testing Requirements

**Guidance:** Verify implementation against the ACs using the following tests. Follow general testing approach in [`docs/testing-strategy.md`](docs/testing-strategy.md:0).

- **Unit Tests ([`tests/unit/commands/manageDeleteCategory.test.ts`](tests/unit/commands/manageDeleteCategory.test.ts:0)):**
    - `manageDeleteCategory.ts` command handler ([`src/commands/manageDeleteCategory.ts`](src/commands/manageDeleteCategory.ts:0)):
        - Mock `inquirer` (using `vi.mock` and `@inquirer/testing`) to simulate user confirmation (yes/no).
        - Mock `DefinitionLoader` ([`src/core/DefinitionLoader.ts`](src/core/DefinitionLoader.ts:0)) / `FileManager` ([`src/core/FileManager.ts`](src/core/FileManager.ts:0)) to:
            - Provide a list of custom categories and custom modes (some referencing the category to be deleted).
            - Simulate the removal of the category and updates to referencing modes' `categorySlugs`.
            - Validate if a slug refers to a non-existent custom category or a system-only category.
        - Mock `FileManager` ([`src/core/FileManager.ts`](src/core/FileManager.ts:0)) to verify it's called correctly to:
            - Read the initial `user-definitions.json`.
            - Write the updated `user-definitions.json` (with the category removed and modes' `categorySlugs` updated).
        - Test error handling for:
            - Attempting to delete a non-existent custom category slug.
            - Attempting to delete a system category slug.
        - Test the cancellation flow (user answers 'no' to confirmation).
- **End-to-End (E2E) Tests ([`tests/e2e/manage-commands.e2e.test.ts`](tests/e2e/manage-commands.e2e.test.ts:0) or similar):**
    - Test the `roo-init manage delete category <slug>` command by executing the CLI (via `cliTestRunner.ts`).
    - Requires setting up a temporary user-global configuration directory using `memfs` with a pre-existing `user-definitions.json`. This JSON should contain:
        - A custom category to be deleted.
        - Custom modes, some of which reference the category to be deleted in their `categorySlugs` array.
    - Simulate user confirmation (yes/no) for the `inquirer` prompt.
    - Verify the orchestration of `DefinitionLoader`, `FileManager`, and `UiManager` by the `manageDeleteCategory` command handler.
    - Assertions:
        - If confirmed 'yes':
            - The category definition is removed from `customCategories` in `user-definitions.json` in the temporary global config dir.
            - The `categorySlugs` array in any referencing custom modes within `user-definitions.json` is updated correctly (slug removed).
            - The CLI provides appropriate success feedback.
        - If confirmed 'no':
            - No changes are made to `user-definitions.json`.
            - The CLI shows a "Deletion cancelled" message.
        - Test AC4 (non-existent custom slug) and AC5 (system slug) by providing such slugs and checking for error messages.
- **Manual/CLI Verification:**
    - First, create a custom category using `roo-init manage add category`.
    - Then, create a custom mode using `roo-init manage add mode` and assign the previously created custom category to it.
    - Run `roo-init manage delete category <slug_of_created_category>` interactively:
        - Confirm 'yes' to deletion. Verify the category is removed from `customCategories` in the actual `~/.config/roo-init/user-definitions.json`.
        - Verify that the `categorySlugs` array of the custom mode (in `customModes`) has been updated to remove the deleted category's slug.
    - Create another custom category. Run `roo-init manage delete category <slug>` again.
        - Confirm 'no' to deletion. Verify no changes were made to `user-definitions.json`.
    - Test error conditions:
        - `roo-init manage delete category nonexistentslug`
        - `roo-init manage delete category <a_system_category_slug>`
