# Story 2.4: Copy Rule Files to `.roo` Directory Structure

**Status:** Draft

## Goal & Context

**User Story:** As a Developer using the interactive mode, after selecting modes, I want the CLI to copy the associated rule files (`.md`) into the correct `.roo/rules/` and `.roo/rules-[mode_slug]/` structure within my target project directory.

**Context:** This story follows the interactive mode trigger (Story 2.1), mode selection (Story 2.2), and `.roomodes` file generation (Story 2.3). It implements the logic for copying the actual rule files associated with the selected modes into the target project's standardized `.roo` directory structure. This is a critical step in providing the user with the necessary documentation and guidelines for the selected modes. The story also incorporates the `--force` flag from Story 2.1 to handle potential overwrite conflicts with existing rule files. This is a key part of Epic 2's goal to deliver the complete interactive MVP workflow ([`docs/epic2.md`](docs/epic2.md:3)).

## Detailed Requirements

- For each selected mode, identify its associated rule files (both generic and mode-specific) based on the loaded definitions (Story 1.3).
- Determine the source path of these rule files within the CLI's bundled assets.
- Determine the target path within the target project directory:
    - Generic rules go into `.roo/rules/`.
    - Mode-specific rules go into `.roo/rules-[mode_slug]/`.
- Create the `.roo` directory and necessary subdirectories (`rules`, `rules-[mode_slug]`) if they don't exist.
- Copy the rule files from the source to the target locations.
- Before copying each rule file, check if the target file already exists.
- If a target file exists and the `--force` flag (from Story 2.1) was *not* provided, report an error (listing all conflicting files found) and halt the process before copying any files.
- If target files exist and `--force` *was* provided, proceed with overwriting them.
- If target files do not exist, copy them normally.

## Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

- AC1: The `.roo` directory is created in the target project if it doesn't exist.
- AC2: For each selected mode, its associated `rules-[mode_slug]` directory is created under `.roo` if it doesn't exist.
- AC3: All generic rule files associated with *any* selected mode are copied to `.roo/rules/`.
- AC4: All mode-specific rule files for *each* selected mode are copied to the corresponding `.roo/rules-[mode_slug]/` directory.
- AC5: File content of copied rules matches the source rule files.
- AC6: If any rule file conflicts exist in the target directories and `--force` is not used, the command fails with an error message listing all conflicts.
- AC7: If rule file conflicts exist and `--force` is used, the existing files are overwritten by the copied files.

## Technical Implementation Context

**Guidance:** Use the following details for implementation. Developer agent is expected to follow project standards in [`docs/coding-standards.md`](docs/coding-standards.md:0) and understand the project structure in [`docs/project-structure.md`](docs/project-structure.md:0). Only story-specific details are included below.

- **Relevant Files:**

  - Files to Modify:
    - [`src/core/FileManager.ts`](src/core/FileManager.ts:0): Add methods to handle creating directories and copying rule files.
    - [`src/cli.ts`](src/cli.ts:0) or [`src/commands/init.ts`](src/commands/init.ts:0): Call the `FileManager` methods to copy rule files after the `.roomodes` file is generated. Pass the list of selected modes and the state of the `--force` flag.
    - [`src/types/domain.ts`](src/types/domain.ts:0): Ensure the `Rule` and `ModeDefinition` interfaces are correctly defined based on [`docs/data-models.md`](docs/data-models.md:0).
    - [`src/utils/errorHandler.ts`](src/utils/errorHandler.ts:0): Implement or utilize error handling for file system issues and overwrite conflicts.
    - [`src/utils/uiManager.ts`](src/utils/uiManager.ts:0): Utilize for displaying progress indicators and success/error messages.

- **Key Technologies:**

  - Node.js (`^20.12.0`)
  - TypeScript (`^5.4.5`)
  - pnpm (`^9.1.0`)
  - `fs-extra` (`^11.2.0` as per [`docs/tech-stack.md`](docs/tech-stack.md:46)): Used for file system operations (`ensureDir`, `copy`, `pathExists`).
  - `DefinitionLoader` (from Story 1.3): Provides access to full mode and rule definitions.
  - `ModeSelector` (from Story 2.2): Provides the list of selected mode slugs.

- **API Interactions / SDK Usage:**

  - Use `fs-extra.ensureDir` to create directories recursively.
  - Use `fs-extra.pathExists` to check for file existence.
  - Use `fs-extra.copy` to copy files.

- **UI/UX Notes:**

  - Provide a progress indicator (e.g., using `ora` via `UiManager`) while copying files.
  - Display a clear success message upon successful file copying.
  - Display a clear error message if an overwrite conflict occurs without `--force`, listing the conflicting files.

- **Data Structures:**

  - Utilize the `Rule` and `ModeDefinition` interfaces from [`src/types/domain.ts`](src/types/domain.ts:0).

- **Environment Variables:**

  - None required for this story ([`docs/environment-vars.md`](docs/environment-vars.md:7)).

- **Coding Standards Notes:**

  - Follow standards defined in [`docs/coding-standards.md`](docs/coding-standards.md:0).
  - Ensure `FileManager` is designed to be injectable ([`docs/architecture.md:170`](docs/architecture.md:170)).
  - Use `async`/`await` for handling asynchronous file system operations ([`docs/coding-standards.md:50`](docs/coding-standards.md:50)).
  - Use JSDoc comments for the `FileManager` class and its methods.

## Testing Requirements

**Guidance:** Verify implementation against the ACs using the following tests. Follow general testing approach in [`docs/testing-strategy.md`](docs/testing-strategy.md:0).

- **Unit Tests:**
    - Test `FileManager`'s logic for determining the correct target paths for generic and mode-specific rule files.
    - Test `FileManager`'s logic for checking file existence and respecting the `--force` flag when copying rule files.
    - Use Vitest mocks (`vi.mock('fs-extra')`) to simulate file system interactions.
- **Integration Tests:**
    - Test the integration between the command handler (`src/cli.ts` or `src/commands/init.ts`), `ModeSelector` (providing selected modes), and `FileManager` (copying files). Use temporary directories for realistic file system interaction testing (as per [`docs/testing-strategy.md`](docs/testing-strategy.md:52)).
    - Test scenarios with and without existing `.roo` directories and rule files, and with and without the `--force` flag (AC1, AC2, AC3, AC4, AC6, AC7).
    - Verify the content of the copied files (AC5).
- **Manual/CLI Verification:**
    - Run `pnpm install`.
    - Run `pnpm run build`.
    - Run `roo-init`, select modes, and verify that the `.roo` directory structure is created and the correct rule files are copied with the correct content (AC1, AC2, AC3, AC4, AC5).
    - Run `roo-init` again in the same directory without `--force` and verify that it fails with an overwrite error listing the conflicting rule files (AC6).
    - Run `roo-init --force` in the same directory and verify that the existing rule files are overwritten (AC7).
