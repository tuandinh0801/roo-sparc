# Story 1.3: Define and Load Mode/Category/Rule Definitions

**Status:** Complete

## Goal & Context

**User Story:** As a Developer, I need the CLI to load predefined mode, category, and rule definitions from its internal bundled data so that this information is available for subsequent processing.

**Context:** This story builds upon the basic CLI framework established in Story 1.1 and the argument parsing implemented in Story 1.2. It focuses on the core data loading mechanism, making the predefined modes, categories, and rules accessible within the application. This is essential for the CLI to know what options to present to the user and which files to copy later. It directly addresses the data loading requirement of Epic 1 ([`docs/epic1.md`](docs/epic1.md:3)).

## Detailed Requirements

- Define the file format and structure for storing mode, category, and rule definitions internally within the CLI package (e.g., JSON files in a `definitions/` directory). Structure should align with [`specs/consolidated_domain_model.md`](../specs/consolidated_domain_model.md).
- Create sample definition files (at least 2-3 modes, 1-2 categories, a few rules including generic and mode-specific).
- Implement a module/service responsible for locating, reading, parsing, and validating these definition files upon CLI startup.
- Make the loaded definitions accessible internally within the application.
- Implement basic validation (e.g., check for required fields in definitions).

## Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

- AC1: The CLI successfully locates and parses the bundled definition files without errors during startup.
- AC2: Loaded data structures in memory accurately reflect the content of the definition files and match the domain model defined in [`docs/data-models.md`](docs/data-models.md:0).
- AC3: Basic validation checks on the definitions pass (or fail informatively if definitions are intentionally invalid for testing).
- AC4: Unit tests verify the loading, parsing, and validation logic for various valid and invalid definition file scenarios.

## Technical Implementation Context

**Guidance:** Use the following details for implementation. Developer agent is expected to follow project standards in [`docs/coding-standards.md`](docs/coding-standards.md:0) and understand the project structure in [`docs/project-structure.md`](docs/project-structure.md:0). Only story-specific details are included below.

- **Relevant Files:**

  - Files to Create:
    - [`definitions/categories.json`](definitions/categories.json:0): Sample category definitions.
    - [`definitions/modes.json`](definitions/modes.json:0): Sample mode definitions, including `associatedRuleFiles`.
    - [`definitions/rules/generic/`](definitions/rules/generic/:0): Directory for generic rules.
    - [`definitions/rules/generic/01_sample_generic_rule.md`](definitions/rules/generic/01_sample_generic_rule.md:0): Sample generic rule file.
    - [`definitions/rules/sample-mode-slug/`](definitions/rules/sample-mode-slug/:0): Directory for mode-specific rules (replace `sample-mode-slug` with an actual slug from your sample modes).
    - [`definitions/rules/sample-mode-slug/sample_mode_rule.md`](definitions/rules/sample-mode-slug/sample_mode_rule.md:0): Sample mode-specific rule file.
    - [`src/types/domain.ts`](src/types/domain.ts:0): Define TypeScript interfaces `Rule`, `CategoryDefinition`, `ModeDefinition` based on [`docs/data-models.md`](docs/data-models.md:0).
    - [`src/core/DefinitionLoader.ts`](src/core/DefinitionLoader.ts:0): Implement the class responsible for loading and validating definitions.
    - [`tests/core/DefinitionLoader.test.ts`](tests/core/DefinitionLoader.test.ts:0): Unit tests for `DefinitionLoader`.

  - Files to Modify:
    - [`src/cli.ts`](src/cli.ts:0): Instantiate `DefinitionLoader` and make the loaded definitions available (e.g., pass to command handlers or store in a central place).

- **Key Technologies:**

  - Node.js (`^20.12.0`)
  - TypeScript (`^5.4.5`)
  - pnpm (`^9.1.0`)
  - `fs-extra` (`^11.2.0` as per [`docs/tech-stack.md`](docs/tech-stack.md:46)): For reading definition files.
  - Vitest (`^1.6.0` as per [`docs/tech-stack.md`](docs/tech-stack.md:62)): For unit testing.

- **API Interactions / SDK Usage:**

  - Use `fs-extra` functions like `readJson` and `readFile`.

- **UI/UX Notes:**

  - N/A for this story.

- **Data Structures:**

  - Implement TypeScript interfaces `Rule`, `CategoryDefinition`, `ModeDefinition` in [`src/types/domain.ts`](src/types/domain.ts:0) as defined in [`docs/data-models.md`](docs/data-models.md:0).

- **Environment Variables:**

  - None required for this story ([`docs/environment-vars.md`](docs/environment-vars.md:7)).

- **Coding Standards Notes:**

  - Follow standards defined in [`docs/coding-standards.md`](docs/coding-standards.md:0).
  - Ensure `DefinitionLoader` is designed to be injectable ([`docs/architecture.md:170`](docs/architecture.md:170)).
  - Use JSDoc comments for the `DefinitionLoader` class and its methods.

## Testing Requirements

**Guidance:** Verify implementation against the ACs using the following tests. Follow general testing approach in [`docs/testing-strategy.md`](docs/testing-strategy.md:0).

- **Unit Tests:**
    - Test `DefinitionLoader`'s ability to read and parse valid `categories.json` and `modes.json`.
    - Test `DefinitionLoader`'s ability to handle invalid JSON or missing required fields (AC3).
    - Test `DefinitionLoader` correctly identifies and stores paths for generic and mode-specific rules based on `associatedRuleFiles` in `modes.json`.
    - Use Vitest mocks (`vi.mock('fs-extra')`) to simulate file system interactions without actually reading/writing files during unit tests.
- **Integration Tests:**
    - N/A for this story.
- **Manual/CLI Verification:**
    - Run `pnpm install`.
    - Run `pnpm run build`.
    - Although there's no direct user-facing output for definition loading in this story, successful build without errors related to `DefinitionLoader` or types is a basic verification. More thorough verification comes from the unit tests (AC4).
