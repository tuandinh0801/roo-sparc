# Story 3.2: Implement Overwrite Protection (`--force` Flag)

**Status:** Draft

## Goal & Context

**User Story:** As a CLI User, I want the tool to prevent accidental overwriting of existing `.roomodes` or rule files, unless I explicitly use a `--force` flag.

**Context:** This story implements the `--force` flag functionality, adding a crucial layer of safety to the CLI's file operations. It modifies the file writing and copying logic developed in Epic 2 (Stories 2.3 and 2.4) to check for existing files and prevent overwriting unless the `--force` flag is present. This builds upon the argument parsing implemented in Story 3.1.

## Detailed Requirements

- Add a `--force` boolean flag to the argument parser.
- Modify the file writing logic (Story 2.3 for `.roomodes`) and file copying logic (Story 2.4 for rules) to check if the target file already exists *before* writing/copying.
- If a target file exists and `--force` is *not* provided:
    - Report an error message indicating which file(s) would be overwritten.
    - Prevent the write/copy operation for that specific file.
    - Halt the entire process on the first conflict found (simpler for MVP).
- If a target file exists and `--force` *is* provided, proceed with overwriting as implemented in Epic 2.

## Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

- AC1: Running `roo-init` (interactive or non-interactive) targeting a directory with an existing `.roomodes` file fails with an error message mentioning the file, unless `--force` is used.
- AC2: Running `roo-init` targeting a directory with existing rule files in `.roo/` fails with an error message mentioning the conflicting files, unless `--force` is used.
- AC3: Running `roo-init --force` successfully overwrites existing `.roomodes` and rule files in the target directory.
- AC4: If only some files conflict, the error message clearly indicates all conflicts found before halting.

## Technical Implementation Context

**Guidance:** Use the following details for implementation. Developer agent is expected to follow project standards in [`docs/coding-standards.md`](docs/coding-standards.md) and understand the project structure in [`docs/project-structure.md`](docs/project-structure.md). Only story-specific details are included below.

- **Relevant Files:**

  - Files to Modify: [`src/cli.ts`](src/cli.ts:0), [`src/core/FileManager.ts`](src/core/FileManager.ts:0)

- **Key Technologies:**

  - `commander` (for argument parsing)
  - `fs-extra` (for file existence checks and conditional writing/copying)
  - TypeScript

- **API Interactions / SDK Usage:**

  - N/A

- **UI/UX Notes:** Error messages for overwrite conflicts should be clear and informative.

- **Data Structures:**

  - N/A

- **Environment Variables:**

  - N/A (as per [`docs/environment-vars.md`](docs/environment-vars.md:0))

- **Coding Standards Notes:**

  - Follow standards in [`docs/coding-standards.md`](docs/coding-standards.md)
  - Ensure the logic for checking file existence and applying the `--force` flag is robust and handles potential race conditions gracefully (though for a CLI, this is less critical than a server).

## Testing Requirements

**Guidance:** Verify implementation against the ACs using the following tests. Follow general testing approach in [`docs/testing-strategy.md`](docs/testing-strategy.md).

- **Unit Tests:**
  - Test `FileManager` logic for checking file existence and applying the `--force` flag during write and copy operations.
- **Integration Tests:**
  - Test the `init` command handler's interaction with `FileManager` when target files exist, verifying correct behavior with and without the `--force` flag.
- **End-to-End (E2E) Tests:**
  - Run the compiled CLI targeting a pre-populated temporary directory, both with and without the `--force` flag.
  - Verify that without `--force`, the command fails with an error message listing conflicting files and exits non-zero.
  - Verify that with `--force`, the command successfully overwrites the existing files and exits zero.
  - Test scenarios with only `.roomodes` conflicting, only rule files conflicting, and both conflicting.

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [ ] Add `--force` flag definition to the argument parser in [`src/cli.ts`](src/cli.ts:0).
- [ ] Modify `FileManager` methods (`writeJson`, `copyFile`) to accept the `--force` flag state.
- [ ] Implement file existence checks within `FileManager` methods before writing/copying.
- [ ] Implement conditional logic within `FileManager` methods based on the `--force` flag.
- [ ] Implement error reporting for overwrite conflicts within `FileManager`.
- [ ] Update [`src/commands/init.ts`](src/commands/init.ts:0) to pass the `--force` flag state to `FileManager`.
- [ ] Add unit tests for `FileManager` covering overwrite protection logic.
- [ ] Add integration tests for the `init` command covering overwrite conflicts.
- [ ] Add E2E tests for `--force` flag behavior with existing files.
