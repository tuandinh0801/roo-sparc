# Story 2.5: Implement Comprehensive Error Handling & User Feedback

**Status:** Draft

## Goal & Context

**User Story:** As a CLI User, I want clear feedback about the process, including success messages and informative error messages when things go wrong (like invalid input, file permission issues, or missing definitions).

**Context:** This story builds upon the previous stories in Epic 2 (2.1, 2.2, 2.3, and 2.4) which implement the core interactive workflow and file operations. This story focuses on making the CLI robust and user-friendly by implementing comprehensive error handling and providing clear feedback to the user throughout the process. This includes success messages, progress indicators, and specific error messages for various failure scenarios. This is the final story in Epic 2, completing the MVP workflow ([`docs/epic2.md`](docs/epic2.md:3)).

## Detailed Requirements

- Implement clear success messages upon completion (e.g., "Project initialized successfully with modes: [list of modes]. Files created/updated in [target directory].").
- Implement specific error handling and user-friendly messages for:
    - Failure to load/parse internal mode/rule definitions (from Story 1.3).
    - File system errors (e.g., lack of write permissions in the target directory, disk full - where detectable).
    - Overwrite conflicts when `--force` is not used (refine from Story 2.3 & 2.4).
    - User aborting interactive prompts (e.g., Ctrl+C).
- Ensure consistent exit codes (e.g., 0 for success, non-zero for errors).
- Add progress indicators during file operations. Simple console logs like "Creating .roomodes...", "Copying rule files..." are sufficient for MVP.

## Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

- AC1: Successful execution prints a clear confirmation message listing applied modes and target directory.
- AC2: Attempting to write to a non-writable directory results in a permission-related error message and non-zero exit code.
- AC3: Internal errors (like failing to load definitions) result in an informative error message and non-zero exit code.
- AC4: Overwrite conflicts without `--force` result in specific error messages listing conflicting files and a non-zero exit code.
- AC5: Simple progress messages are logged to the console during file operations.
- AC6: All error conditions result in a non-zero exit code. Successful completion results in a zero exit code.
- AC7: Aborting interactive prompts results in a clear message and non-zero exit code.

## Technical Implementation Context

**Guidance:** Use the following details for implementation. Developer agent is expected to follow project standards in [`docs/coding-standards.md`](docs/coding-standards.md:0) and understand the project structure in [`docs/project-structure.md`](docs/project-structure.md:0). Only story-specific details is included below.

- **Relevant Files:**

  - Files to Modify:
    - [`src/cli.ts`](src/cli.ts:0) or [`src/commands/init.ts`](src/commands/init.ts:0): Integrate error handling and feedback mechanisms into the main workflow.
    - [`src/utils/errorHandler.ts`](src/utils/errorHandler.ts:0): Centralize error handling logic and message formatting.
    - [`src/utils/uiManager.ts`](src/utils/uiManager.ts:0): Implement methods for displaying success messages, progress indicators (using `ora`), and formatted error messages (using `boxen`).

- **Key Technologies:**

  - Node.js (`^20.12.0`)
  - TypeScript (`^5.4.5`)
  - pnpm (`^9.1.0`)
  - `enquirer` (`^2.4.1`): For handling user aborts during prompts.
  - `fs-extra` (`^11.2.0`): For detecting file system errors.
  - `ora` (`^8.0.1` as per [`docs/tech-stack.md`](docs/tech-stack.md:34)): For progress spinners.
  - `boxen` (`^7.1.1` as per [`docs/tech-stack.md`](docs/tech-stack.md:37)): For formatting messages.
  - `cli-table3` (`^0.6.5` as per [`docs/tech-stack.md`](docs/tech-stack.md:40)): Potentially for listing conflicting files in error messages.
  - `gradient-string` (`^2.0.2` as per [`docs/tech-stack.md`](docs/tech-stack.md:43)): Potentially for styling success messages.

- **API Interactions / SDK Usage:**

  - Utilize error handling patterns with `async`/`await` (`try...catch`).
  - Use `process.exit` with appropriate exit codes.

- **UI/UX Notes:**

  - Ensure error messages are user-friendly and provide actionable information.
  - Progress indicators should be displayed during file operations (writing `.roomodes`, copying rules).
  - Success messages should clearly indicate what was done.

- **Data Structures:**

  - N/A for this story.

- **Environment Variables:**

  - None required for this story ([`docs/environment-vars.md`](docs/environment-vars.md:7)).

- **Coding Standards Notes:**

  - Follow standards defined in [`docs/coding-standards.md`](docs/coding-standards.md:0).
  - Implement centralized error handling in [`src/utils/errorHandler.ts`](src/utils/errorHandler.ts:0) ([`docs/coding-standards.md:81`](docs/coding-standards.md:81)).
  - Use `async`/`await` with `try...catch` for error handling in asynchronous operations ([`docs/coding-standards.md:87`](docs/coding-standards.md:87)).
  - Use JSDoc comments for error handling and UI utility functions.

## Testing Requirements

**Guidance:** Verify implementation against the ACs using the following tests. Follow general testing approach in [`docs/testing-strategy.md`](docs/testing-strategy.md:0).

- **Unit Tests:**
    - Test `errorHandler`'s ability to format different types of errors into user-friendly messages.
    - Test `uiManager`'s methods for displaying success messages, progress indicators (mocking `ora`), and formatted error messages (mocking `boxen`).
- **Integration Tests:**
    - Test the integration of error handling within the command handler (`src/cli.ts` or `src/commands/init.ts`).
    - Simulate various error conditions (e.g., mocking `fs-extra` to throw errors, simulating invalid definitions) and verify that the correct error messages are displayed and the process exits with a non-zero code (AC2, AC3, AC4, AC6).
    - Simulate user abort during interactive prompts and verify the correct message and exit code (AC7).
    - Test successful execution and verify the success message and zero exit code (AC1, AC6).
- **Manual/CLI Verification:**
    - Run `pnpm install`.
    - Run `pnpm run build`.
    - Run `roo-init` and complete the process successfully, verifying the success message (AC1).
    - Manually create scenarios that trigger errors (e.g., make the target directory read-only, modify definition files to be invalid) and verify the error messages and exit codes (AC2, AC3, AC4, AC6).
    - Run `roo-init` and abort during a prompt (Ctrl+C), verifying the abort message and exit code (AC7).
    - Observe the console output during file operations to verify progress messages (AC5).
