# Story 4.5: Implement `edit custom mode` Command

**Status:** Draft

## Goal & Context

**User Story:** As a CLI User, I want an interactive command `roo-init manage edit mode <slug>` to modify an existing custom mode, including its rules and rule content, so I can keep my personalized configurations up-to-date.

**Context:** This story implements the "Update" capability for custom modes, following the "Create" (Story 4.2) and "Read" (Story 4.4) functionalities. Users will be able to select one of their existing custom modes by its slug and interactively edit its metadata and associated rules (including adding new rules, editing existing ones, or deleting rules). Changes will be persisted in `~/.config/roo-init/user-definitions.json` and the corresponding rule files in `~/.config/roo-init/rules/`. This is a critical part of the full CRUD lifecycle for custom modes.

## Detailed Requirements

- Create the `roo-init manage edit mode <slug>` command. The `<slug>` argument is mandatory.
- Load the specified custom mode from `user-definitions.json` using `DefinitionLoader` or `FileManager`. If a custom mode with the given slug is not found, display an error message and exit.
- Interactively prompt for changes to each field of the mode:
    - `name`: Show current, prompt for new.
    - `description` (`roleDefinition`): Show current, prompt for new.
    - `customInstructions`: Show current, prompt for new (can be multi-line, consider `editor` prompt or clear instructions for `\n`).
    - `groups`: Show current, prompt for new (similar input mechanism as add mode).
    - `categorySlugs`: Show current, prompt for new (multi-select from existing system AND custom categories).
    - The `slug` of a custom mode *cannot* be edited. If users need to change a slug, they should delete the old mode and add a new one. This simplifies the logic significantly.
- For `associatedRuleFiles`:
    - Display a list of current rules for the mode (name, filename, description, isGeneric).
    - Offer options: `[A]dd new rule`, `[E]dit existing rule`, `[D]elete existing rule`, `[C]ontinue without rule changes`.
    - **Add new rule:** Follows the same interactive flow as Story 4.2 (prompt for metadata, editor for content, save file, update mode object).
    - **Edit existing rule:**
        - Prompt user to select a rule to edit from the list.
        - For the selected rule, prompt for new metadata (name, filename, description, isGeneric). The original filename should be used if a new one isn't provided or if filename changes are complex to manage (renaming file, updating sourcePath). For MVP, disallow filename changes during edit; user can delete and re-add if filename must change.
        - Use an `editor` prompt for the rule's Markdown content, pre-filled with existing content.
        - Save updated content to `~/.config/roo-init/rules/[mode_slug]/[filename]`.
        - Update rule metadata in the mode object.
    - **Delete existing rule:**
        - Prompt user to select a rule to delete from the list.
        - Confirm deletion.
        - Delete the rule file from `~/.config/roo-init/rules/[mode_slug]/[filename]`.
        - Remove the rule's metadata from the `associatedRuleFiles` array in the mode object.
        - If the `~/.config/roo-init/rules/[mode_slug]/` directory becomes empty after deleting rules, it can be optionally removed.
- After all changes, update the mode definition in the `customModes` array in `~/.config/roo-init/user-definitions.json`.

## Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

- AC1: User can successfully invoke `roo-init manage edit mode <existing_custom_mode_slug>` and is prompted to edit its fields.
- AC2: User can modify text fields (name, description, customInstructions), and selection fields (groups, categorySlugs) for the custom mode.
- AC3: For associated rules, user can:
    - Add a new rule, including its content via editor prompt (file saved, mode object updated).
    - Edit an existing rule's metadata (except filename for MVP) and content via editor prompt (file updated, mode object updated).
    - Delete an existing rule (file deleted, mode object updated).
- AC4: All changes to the mode definition and its rules are correctly saved to `user-definitions.json` and the corresponding rule files/directories in `~/.config/roo-init/rules/`.
- AC5: Attempting to edit a non-existent custom mode slug (e.g., `roo-init manage edit mode nonexistentslug`) results in a clear error message.
- AC6: Attempting to edit a *system* mode slug results in an error message (e.g., "System modes cannot be edited. To override, create a custom mode with the same slug.").
- AC7: The `slug` field of the custom mode is not presented as an editable field.
- AC8: Clear feedback is provided upon successful update.

## Technical Implementation Context

**Guidance:** Use the following details for implementation. Developer agent is expected to follow project standards in [`docs/coding-standards.md`](docs/coding-standards.md:0) and understand the project structure in [`docs/project-structure.md`](docs/project-structure.md:0). Only story-specific details are included below.

- **Relevant Files:**
    - Files to Create:
        - `src/commands/manageEditMode.ts`
        - `tests/commands/manageEditMode.test.ts`
    - Files to Modify:
        - [`src/cli.ts`](src/cli.ts:0): Register the new command.
        - [`src/core/FileManager.ts`](src/core/FileManager.ts:0): Methods to update `user-definitions.json` (modify existing mode), save/delete custom rule files, potentially delete empty rule directories.
        - [`src/utils/uiManager.ts`](src/utils/uiManager.ts:0): For complex prompt sequences, including listing rules for selection.
        - [`src/core/DefinitionLoader.ts`](src/core/DefinitionLoader.ts:0): To fetch specific custom mode details and existing categories.
- **Key Technologies:**
    - `commander`: For command and argument parsing.
    - `inquirer`: For all interactive prompts, including `list` (for selecting rules to edit/delete) and `editor`.
    - `fs-extra`: For file operations.
- **API Interactions / SDK Usage:**
    - `DefinitionLoader.getCustomDefinitions()`: To find the mode to edit.
    - `FileManager.readUserDefinitions()`, `FileManager.writeUserDefinitions()`: For `user-definitions.json`.
    - `FileManager.saveCustomRuleFile()`, `FileManager.deleteCustomRuleFile(modeSlug, ruleFilename)` (new), `FileManager.readCustomRuleFile(modeSlug, ruleFilename)` (new, for pre-filling editor).
    - `inquirer.prompt()`.
- **UI/UX Notes:**
    - Present current values clearly before prompting for new ones.
    - The rule management part can be a sub-loop.
    - Confirm destructive actions like deleting a rule.
- **Data Structures:**
    - `ModeDefinition`, `CategoryDefinition`, `Rule` from [`docs/data-models.md`](docs/data-models.md:0).
- **Environment Variables:**
    - None.
- **Coding Standards Notes:**
    - The command handler will be complex; break down logic into smaller functions.
    - State management for the mode object being edited is important.

## Testing Requirements

**Guidance:** Verify implementation against the ACs using the following tests. Follow general testing approach in [`docs/testing-strategy.md`](docs/testing-strategy.md:0).

- **Unit Tests:**
    - `manageEditMode.ts` command handler:
        - Mock `inquirer` for all prompt flows (editing fields, adding/editing/deleting rules).
        - Mock `DefinitionLoader` to provide a custom mode to edit.
        - Mock `FileManager` to verify calls for reading/writing mode definition and rule files/content.
        - Test error handling for non-existent slug or system slug.
- **Integration Tests:**
    - Test with a temporary global `user-definitions.json` and rule files.
    - Programmatically (mocking `inquirer`) invoke the command to:
        - Modify mode metadata.
        - Add a new rule.
        - Edit an existing rule's content and metadata.
        - Delete a rule.
    - Verify that `user-definitions.json` and rule files in the temporary global config directory are correctly updated/deleted.
- **Manual/CLI Verification:**
    - Create a custom mode using `manage add mode`.
    - Run `roo-init manage edit mode <slug>`:
        - Edit various fields.
        - Add a new rule.
        - Edit an existing rule's content and metadata.
        - Delete an existing rule.
    - Verify all changes in `~/.config/roo-init/user-definitions.json` and rule files.
    - Test error for non-existent slug.
    - Test error for trying to edit a system slug.
