# Story 4.1: Setup User-Global Storage & Enhance Definition Loading

**Status:** Draft

## Goal & Context

**User Story:** As a Developer, the CLI needs to establish and manage user-specific global storage for custom modes/categories and their rules, and the definition loading mechanism must incorporate these custom definitions.

**Context:** This story is foundational for Epic 4, which aims to empower users with full lifecycle management for their own custom modes and categories. It enables the CLI to recognize and use definitions stored in the user's global configuration directory (e.g., `~/.config/roo-init/`). This involves modifying the existing `DefinitionLoader` to read from this new location, merge these custom definitions with the bundled system definitions, and handle potential conflicts by giving precedence to user definitions. This story directly enables subsequent stories that involve adding, editing, listing, and deleting custom modes and categories (Stories 4.2 - 4.8). It builds upon the core definition loading capabilities established in Epic 1.

## Detailed Requirements

- Implement logic to determine the user-specific configuration directory path (cross-platform, e.g., `~/.config/roo-init/`).
- Ensure `~/.config/roo-init/` and its subdirectory `~/.config/roo-init/rules/` are created by the `FileManager` or an equivalent utility if they don't exist when first needed (e.g., when `DefinitionLoader` attempts to read or `FileManager` attempts to write custom definitions/rules).
- Modify `DefinitionLoader` ([`src/core/DefinitionLoader.ts`](src/core/DefinitionLoader.ts:0)) to:
    - Attempt to read and parse `user-definitions.json` from the user-specific configuration directory (e.g., `~/.config/roo-init/user-definitions.json`). If the file doesn't exist or is invalid (e.g., malformed JSON), it should be treated as if there are no custom definitions, and the process should continue gracefully with only system definitions (or log a warning about the invalid file).
    - Merge loaded custom modes and categories with the bundled system definitions.
    - If a custom mode's or category's slug matches a system slug, the custom definition must take precedence and effectively replace the system one in the merged list used by the application (e.g., by `ModeSelector`).
    - The `DefinitionLoader` should make the merged list available. (Note: Slug uniqueness *among other custom definitions* will be primarily enforced by the `add`/`edit` commands in later stories, but the loader should correctly handle whatever valid data is present in `user-definitions.json`).

## Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

- AC1: The CLI can correctly identify the user-global configuration directory path (e.g., `~/.config/roo-init/`) and can ensure this directory and its `rules` subdirectory are created if they don't exist when an operation requires them.
- AC2: `DefinitionLoader` successfully loads and merges system definitions with valid custom definitions from `user-definitions.json` if it exists and is valid.
- AC3: If `user-definitions.json` is missing, empty, or contains malformed JSON, `DefinitionLoader` operates correctly with only system definitions (or system definitions + a clear warning about the malformed user file) and does not crash.
- AC4: If a custom mode/category slug in `user-definitions.json` duplicates a system slug, the custom definition (from user-global store) is used by services like `ModeSelector` and thus by the `roo-init` main command when listing or selecting modes/categories.
- AC5: Unit tests for `DefinitionLoader` verify the merging logic, including correct precedence for custom definitions over system definitions with conflicting slugs, and graceful handling of missing or invalid `user-definitions.json`.
- AC6: The source path for rules within custom modes (e.g., in `user-definitions.json`) should correctly point to their location within the user's global rule storage (e.g., `[custom_mode_slug]/my-custom-rule.md` relative to `~/.config/roo-init/rules/`).

## Technical Implementation Context

**Guidance:** Use the following details for implementation. Developer agent is expected to follow project standards in [`docs/coding-standards.md`](docs/coding-standards.md:0) and understand the project structure in [`docs/project-structure.md`](docs/project-structure.md:0). Only story-specific details are included below.

- **Relevant Files:**
    - Files to Modify:
        - [`src/core/DefinitionLoader.ts`](src/core/DefinitionLoader.ts:0): Major changes to implement loading from user-global scope, merging, and precedence logic. Refer to [`docs/architecture.md:212`](docs/architecture.md:212) & [`docs/architecture.md:239`](docs/architecture.md:239).
        - [`src/core/FileManager.ts`](src/core/FileManager.ts:0): Potentially enhance to ensure creation of user-global config directories (`~/.config/roo-init/` and `~/.config/roo-init/rules/`) if they don't exist when needed. Refer to [`docs/architecture.md:216`](docs/architecture.md:216).
        - [`src/types/domain.ts`](src/types/domain.ts:0): Ensure types are consistent with potentially merged definitions or if `source` property needs to be more dynamic (e.g. 'system', 'user').
- **Key Technologies:**
    - Node.js: `os` module (specifically `os.homedir()`) to construct paths to user configuration directories (e.g., `~/.config/` on Linux/macOS, `%APPDATA%` on Windows). Consider using a library like `env-paths` for robust cross-platform config directory resolution.
    - `fs-extra`: For reading `user-definitions.json` and ensuring directory existence (`ensureDir`).
- **API Interactions / SDK Usage:**
    - `fs-extra.readJson(filePath)`: To read `user-definitions.json`.
    - `fs-extra.pathExists(filePath)`: To check for existence.
    - `fs-extra.ensureDir(dirPath)`: To create directories if they don't exist.
- **UI/UX Notes:**
    - Primarily backend changes. Any errors related to loading invalid custom definitions should be logged gracefully, perhaps with a verbose flag for detailed issues.
- **Data Structures:**
    - `ModeDefinition`, `CategoryDefinition`, `Rule` interfaces from [`docs/data-models.md`](docs/data-models.md:0).
    - The structure of `user-definitions.json` will mirror the bundled `modes.json` and `categories.json` but will contain arrays for `customModes` and `customCategories`.
    - Example `user-definitions.json` structure (conceptual):
      ```json
      {
        "customModes": [ /* array of ModeDefinition objects */ ],
        "customCategories": [ /* array of CategoryDefinition objects */ ]
      }
      ```
- **Environment Variables:**
    - None directly for this story. Refer to [`docs/environment-vars.md`](docs/environment-vars.md:0).
- **Coding Standards Notes:**
    - Follow standards in [`docs/coding-standards.md`](docs/coding-standards.md:0).
    - Pay attention to error handling when reading/parsing `user-definitions.json`.
    - Ensure JSDoc comments are updated for modified functions in `DefinitionLoader`.

## Testing Requirements

**Guidance:** Verify implementation against the ACs using the following tests. Follow general testing approach in [`docs/testing-strategy.md`](docs/testing-strategy.md:0).

- **Unit Tests:**
    - `DefinitionLoader`:
        - Test loading with no `user-definitions.json` present.
        - Test loading with an empty `user-definitions.json` (e.g., `{"customModes": [], "customCategories": []}`).
        - Test loading with a `user-definitions.json` containing valid custom modes and categories that do not conflict with system definitions. Verify correct merge.
        - Test loading with custom modes/categories that have slugs conflicting with system definitions. Verify custom definitions take precedence.
        - Test loading with a malformed `user-definitions.json`. Verify graceful error handling (e.g., logs a warning, proceeds with system definitions).
        - Test correct resolution of rule `sourcePath` for custom rules (e.g., pointing to `~/.config/roo-init/rules/...`).
    - `FileManager` (or utility responsible for path resolution/creation):
        - Test logic for determining user-specific configuration directory path cross-platform (if implemented directly, or mock library like `env-paths`).
        - Test `ensureDir` functionality for creating `~/.config/roo-init/` and `~/.config/roo-init/rules/` when they don't exist (using mocked `fs-extra` or temporary directories).
- **Integration Tests:**
    - Test interaction between `DefinitionLoader` and `FileManager` regarding the path to `user-definitions.json`.
    - Test `ModeSelector` using a `DefinitionLoader` instance that provides merged (system + custom) definitions, ensuring custom definitions are preferred and listed correctly.
- **Manual/CLI Verification:**
    - After implementing, manually create a `user-definitions.json` file in the expected global config location.
    - Run `roo-init` (interactive mode) or `roo-init manage list modes --source=all` (once Story 4.4 is done) to verify that:
        - Custom modes/categories are listed.
        - Custom modes/categories override system ones if slugs conflict.

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [ ] **Determine User Config Path:**
    - [ ] Research and select a robust method for determining the user-specific configuration directory path (e.g., `~/.config/roo-init/` or platform-specific equivalents using `os` module or a library like `env-paths`).
    - [ ] Implement a utility function to get this path.
- [ ] **Directory Management:**
    - [ ] In `FileManager` or a suitable utility, implement logic to ensure `~/.config/roo-init/` and `~/.config/roo-init/rules/` are created if they don't exist when needed (e.g., before attempting to read `user-definitions.json` or write custom rules). Use `fs-extra.ensureDir`.
- [ ] **Modify `DefinitionLoader`:**
    - [ ] Update `DefinitionLoader` to attempt reading `user-definitions.json` from the user-global configuration path.
    - [ ] Implement parsing logic for `user-definitions.json`. It should expect an object containing `customModes` and `customCategories` arrays.
    - [ ] Handle cases where `user-definitions.json` is missing, empty, or contains invalid JSON (log warning, proceed with system definitions).
    - [ ] Implement merging logic:
        - Combine system modes with custom modes.
        - Combine system categories with custom categories.
    - [ ] Implement precedence logic: If a custom mode/category slug matches a system one, the custom definition should replace the system one in the final merged list.
    - [ ] Ensure rule `sourcePath` for custom rules correctly reflects their location within the user's global rules directory (e.g., `[custom_mode_slug]/rule_file.md` relative to `~/.config/roo-init/rules/`). The `DefinitionLoader` might need to adjust these paths or expect them to be stored correctly.
    - [ ] Update internal data structures or return types if necessary to reflect the merged definitions.
- [ ] **Update Types:**
    - [ ] Review and update types in [`src/types/domain.ts`](src/types/domain.ts:0) if needed (e.g., to distinguish source of definition like 'system' or 'user').
- [ ] **Unit Testing:**
    - [ ] Write comprehensive unit tests for `DefinitionLoader` covering all ACs related to loading, merging, precedence, and error handling.
    - [ ] Write unit tests for user config path utility and directory creation logic.
- [ ] **Documentation:**
    - [ ] Update JSDoc for modified functions/classes.
    - [ ] Briefly note changes in [`docs/architecture.md`](docs/architecture.md:0) if `DefinitionLoader`'s responsibilities significantly expand.
