# Story 3.3: Implement Comprehensive Error Handling & User Feedback

**Status:** Draft

## Goal & Context

**User Story:** As a CLI User, I want clear feedback about the process, including success messages and informative error messages when things go wrong (like invalid input, file permission issues, or missing definitions).

**Context:** This story focuses on refining the user feedback and error handling mechanisms across both interactive and non-interactive modes. It builds upon the basic error handling and progress indication introduced in Epic 2 and integrates with the new non-interactive features and overwrite protection implemented in Stories 3.1 and 3.2. This story ensures the CLI provides a robust and user-friendly experience by clearly communicating the outcome of operations and guiding users when errors occur.

## Detailed Requirements

- Implement clear success messages upon completion (e.g., "Project initialized successfully with modes: [list of modes]. Files created/updated in [target directory].").
- Implement specific error handling and user-friendly messages for:
    - Invalid mode/category slugs provided via flags (refine from Story 3.1).
    - Failure to load/parse internal mode/rule definitions.
    - File system errors (e.g., lack of write permissions in the target directory, disk full - where detectable).
    - Overwrite conflicts (refine from Story 3.2).
    - User aborting interactive prompts (e.g., Ctrl+C).
- Ensure consistent exit codes (e.g., 0 for success, non-zero for errors).
- Add progress indicators, especially for potentially longer operations (though MVP operations should be fast). Simple console logs like "Creating .roomodes...", "Copying rule files..." are sufficient for MVP.

## Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

- AC1: Successful execution (interactive or non-interactive) prints a clear confirmation message listing applied modes and target directory.
- AC2: Providing invalid slugs via flags results in a specific error message and non-zero exit code.
- AC3: Attempting to write to a non-writable directory results in a permission-related error message and non-zero exit code.
- AC4: Internal errors (like failing to load definitions) result in an informative error message and non-zero exit code.
- AC5: Simple progress messages are logged to the console during file operations.
- AC6: All error conditions result in a non-zero exit code. Successful completion results in a zero exit code.
- AC7: Aborting interactive prompts results in a clear message and non-zero exit code.

## Technical Implementation Context

**Guidance:** Use the following details for implementation. Developer agent is expected to follow project standards in [`docs/coding-standards.md`](docs/coding-standards.md) and understand the project structure in [`docs/project-structure.md`](docs/project-structure.md). Only story-specific details are included below.

- **Relevant Files:**

  - Files to Modify: [`src/cli.ts`](src/cli.ts:0), [`src/commands/init.ts`](src/commands/init.ts:0), [`src/utils/errorHandler.ts`](src/utils/errorHandler.ts:0), [`src/utils/uiManager.ts`](src/utils/uiManager.ts:0)

- **Key Technologies:**

  - TypeScript
  - `process.exit()` (for setting exit codes)
  - Console logging (potentially styled using `chalk`, `boxen`, `ora` via `uiManager`)

- **API Interactions / SDK Usage:**

  - N/A

- **UI/UX Notes:** Use the `uiManager` utility for consistent styling of messages (success, error, progress).

- **Data Structures:**

  - N/A

- **Environment Variables:**

  - N/A (as per [`docs/environment-vars.md`](docs/environment-vars.md:0))

- **Coding Standards Notes:**

  - Follow standards in [`docs/coding-standards.md`](docs/coding-standards.md)
  - Centralize error handling logic as much as possible in `errorHandler`.
  - Use specific error types where appropriate (as per [`docs/coding-standards.md`](docs/coding-standards.md)).

## Testing Requirements

**Guidance:** Verify implementation against the ACs using the following tests. Follow general testing approach in [`docs/testing-strategy.md`](docs/testing-strategy.md).

- **Unit Tests:**
  - Test `errorHandler` utility for formatting different error types and setting exit codes.
  - Test `uiManager` for correctly displaying different types of messages (success, error, progress).
- **Integration Tests:**
  - Test the `init` command handler's ability to catch errors from downstream services (`ModeSelector`, `FileManager`) and report them using the error handling utilities.
- **End-to-End (E2E) Tests:**
  - Run the compiled CLI in various error scenarios (invalid slugs, non-writable directory, simulating internal definition loading failure, triggering overwrite conflicts without `--force`, simulating user abort).
  - Verify that the correct, user-friendly error messages are displayed on the console.
  - Verify that the command exits with a non-zero exit code in all error scenarios.
  - Verify that successful execution prints the correct success message and exits zero.
  - Verify that simple progress messages are displayed during file operations.

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [ ] Refine error handling logic in [`src/utils/errorHandler.ts`](src/utils/errorHandler.ts:0) to handle specific error types and ensure correct exit codes.
- [ ] Implement success message display logic in [`src/commands/init.ts`](src/commands/init.ts:0) using `uiManager`.
- [ ] Integrate error handling from `ModeSelector` and `FileManager` into the `init` command handler in [`src/commands/init.ts`](src/commands/init.ts:0), using `errorHandler`.
- [ ] Add progress indication (simple console logs or `ora` spinners via `uiManager`) in [`src/commands/init.ts`](src/commands/init.ts:0) for file operations.
- [ ] Ensure user abort (Ctrl+C) is caught and handled gracefully with an error message and non-zero exit code.
- [ ] Add unit tests for `errorHandler` and `uiManager` message display.
- [ ] Add integration tests for error propagation and handling in the `init` command.
- [ ] Add E2E tests covering all specified error scenarios and success case, verifying messages and exit codes.
