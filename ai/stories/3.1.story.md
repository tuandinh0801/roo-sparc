# Story 3.1: Implement Non-Interactive Mode Flags (`--modes`, `--category`)

**Status:** Draft

## Goal & Context

**User Story:** As a CLI User, I want to specify modes or categories directly via command-line flags (`--modes`, `--category`) so that I can automate project initialization in scripts.

**Context:** This story implements the non-interactive mode of the CLI, allowing users to bypass the interactive prompts and specify their desired modes or categories directly via command-line arguments. This builds upon the core CLI framework established in Epic 1 and the file generation logic from Epic 2. It is the first step in enabling automated project initialization workflows.

## Detailed Requirements

- Add `--modes` flag to the argument parser, accepting a comma-separated list of mode slugs.
- Add `--category` flag to the argument parser, accepting a comma-separated list of category slugs.
- Update the main CLI logic to detect these flags. If present, bypass the interactive prompts (from Epic 2).
- Validate the provided slugs against the loaded definitions (from Story 1.3). Report errors for invalid/unknown slugs.
- Resolve the provided mode/category slugs to the final list of `ModeDefinition` objects to be processed. Handle potential duplicates if a mode is specified directly and also belongs to a specified category.

## Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

- AC1: Running `roo-init --modes <slug1>,<slug2>` executes the initialization process for the specified modes without interactive prompts.
- AC2: Running `roo-init --category <cat1>` executes the initialization process for all modes within that category without interactive prompts.
- AC3: Running `roo-init --modes <slug1> --category <cat1>` correctly resolves and processes all unique modes from both the direct slug and the category.
- AC4: Running with an invalid slug (e.g., `roo-init --modes non-existent-mode`) produces a clear error message listing the invalid slug(s) and exits non-zero.
- AC5: Running with valid flags correctly triggers the file generation steps (Story 2.3, 2.4) using the resolved modes.

## Technical Implementation Context

**Guidance:** Use the following details for implementation. Developer agent is expected to follow project standards in [`docs/coding-standards.md`](docs/coding-standards.md) and understand the project structure in [`docs/project-structure.md`](docs/project-structure.md). Only story-specific details are included below.

- **Relevant Files:**

  - Files to Modify: [`src/cli.ts`](src/cli.ts:0), [`src/commands/init.ts`](src/commands/init.ts:0), [`src/core/ModeSelector.ts`](src/core/ModeSelector.ts:0)

- **Key Technologies:**

  - `commander` (for argument parsing)
  - TypeScript

- **API Interactions / SDK Usage:**

  - N/A

- **UI/UX Notes:** This story focuses on the non-interactive flow, bypassing user prompts. Error messages should be printed to the console.

- **Data Structures:**

  - `ModeDefinition` (as defined in [`docs/data-models.md`](docs/data-models.md:0) and [`src/types/domain.ts`](src/types/domain.ts:0))
  - `CategoryDefinition` (as defined in [`docs/data-models.md`](docs/data-models.md:0) and [`src/types/domain.ts`](src/types/domain.ts:0))

- **Environment Variables:**

  - N/A (as per [`docs/environment-vars.md`](docs/environment-vars.md:0))

- **Coding Standards Notes:**

  - Follow standards in [`docs/coding-standards.md`](docs/coding-standards.md)
  - Ensure clear separation of concerns between argument parsing, mode selection logic, and file operations.

## Testing Requirements

**Guidance:** Verify implementation against the ACs using the following tests. Follow general testing approach in [`docs/testing-strategy.md`](docs/testing-strategy.md).

- **Unit Tests:**
  - Test `ModeSelector` logic for resolving modes from `--modes` and `--category` flags, including handling invalid slugs and duplicates.
- **Integration Tests:**
  - Test the `init` command handler's ability to correctly process `--modes` and `--category` flags and trigger subsequent file generation steps.
- **End-to-End (E2E) Tests:**
  - Run the compiled CLI with various combinations of `--modes` and `--category` flags, verifying that interactive prompts are skipped, correct files are generated in a temporary directory, and invalid slugs result in appropriate error messages and non-zero exit codes.

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [ ] Add `--modes` and `--category` flag definitions to the argument parser in [`src/cli.ts`](src/cli.ts:0).
- [ ] Implement logic in [`src/commands/init.ts`](src/commands/init.ts:0) to detect non-interactive mode trigger based on flags.
- [ ] Update `ModeSelector` to accept mode/category slugs as input for non-interactive selection.
- [ ] Implement slug validation against loaded definitions within `ModeSelector`.
- [ ] Implement logic in `ModeSelector` to resolve flags to a final list of unique modes.
- [ ] Integrate resolved modes with existing file generation logic in [`src/commands/init.ts`](src/commands/init.ts:0).
- [ ] Add unit tests for `ModeSelector` covering non-interactive logic.
- [ ] Add integration tests for the `init` command covering non-interactive flag processing.
- [ ] Add E2E tests for non-interactive mode with valid and invalid inputs.
