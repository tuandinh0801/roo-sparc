# Story 2.2: Interactive Mode Discovery & Selection (Categories & Modes)

**Status:** Draft

## Goal & Context

**User Story:** As a CLI User in interactive mode, I want to be presented with a list of available modes, grouped by category, and be able to select one or more modes for my project.

**Context:** This story builds upon the interactive mode trigger implemented in Story 2.1 and the definition loading from Story 1.3. It focuses on the user interaction aspect of the CLI, using an interactive prompt library to guide the user through selecting categories and modes. The selected modes will be used in subsequent stories (2.3 and 2.4) for file generation and copying. This is a core part of Epic 2's goal to implement the interactive workflow ([`docs/epic2.md`](docs/epic2.md:3)).

## Detailed Requirements

- Utilize the loaded definitions (from Story 1.3).
- Present users with a list of categories first (using checkbox prompt for multi-select).
- Based on selected categories (or an option like "Show all modes"), present a list of corresponding modes (using checkbox prompt for multi-select), displaying mode name and description.
- Allow users to confirm their final selection of modes.
- Handle the case where no modes are selected.

## Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

- AC1: User is prompted to select categories from the available list.
- AC2: User is prompted to select modes based on chosen categories (or all modes). Mode names and descriptions are displayed.
- AC3: User can select multiple modes using the interactive prompt (e.g., spacebar with `inquirer` checkboxes).
- AC4: The CLI correctly captures the list of selected mode slugs based on user interaction.
- AC5: If the user selects no modes, the process informs them and potentially exits gracefully or re-prompts (TBD final behavior).

## Technical Implementation Context

**Guidance:** Use the following details for implementation. Developer agent is expected to follow project standards in [`docs/coding-standards.md`](docs/coding-standards.md:0) and understand the project structure in [`docs/project-structure.md`](docs/project-structure.md:0). Only story-specific details are included below.

- **Relevant Files:**

  - Files to Create:
    - [`src/core/ModeSelector.ts`](src/core/ModeSelector.ts:0): Implement the class responsible for handling interactive mode selection logic.
  - Files to Modify:
    - [`src/cli.ts`](src/cli.ts:0): Instantiate `ModeSelector` and call its interactive selection method when interactive mode is triggered. Pass the loaded definitions and the state of the `--force` flag to `ModeSelector`.
    - [`src/types/domain.ts`](src/types/domain.ts:0): Ensure the `CategoryDefinition` and `ModeDefinition` interfaces are correctly defined based on [`docs/data-models.md`](docs/data-models.md:0).
    - [`src/utils/uiManager.ts`](src/utils/uiManager.ts:0): Centralize the usage of `enquirer` for prompts. `ModeSelector` should interact with `enquirer` via `UiManager`.

- **Key Technologies:**

  - Node.js (`^20.12.0`)
  - TypeScript (`^5.4.5`)
  - pnpm (`^9.1.0`)
  - `enquirer` (`^2.4.1` as per [`docs/tech-stack.md`](docs/tech-stack.md:26)): Used for interactive prompts.
  - `commander` (`^17.7.2`): Used in `src/cli.ts` to trigger the interactive flow.
  - `DefinitionLoader` (from Story 1.3): Provides access to loaded definitions.

- **API Interactions / SDK Usage:**

  - Use `enquirer` methods for creating checkbox prompts.

- **UI/UX Notes:**

  - The prompts should clearly display category and mode names and descriptions.
  - Consider using `cli-table3` (as per [`docs/tech-stack.md`](docs/tech-stack.md:39)) via `UiManager` for displaying modes in a structured way if needed, although simple list prompts might suffice for MVP.

- **Data Structures:**

  - Utilize the `CategoryDefinition` and `ModeDefinition` interfaces from [`src/types/domain.ts`](src/types/domain.ts:0).

- **Environment Variables:**

  - None required for this story ([`docs/environment-vars.md`](docs/environment-vars.md:7)).

- **Coding Standards Notes:**

  - Follow standards defined in [`docs/coding-standards.md`](docs/coding-standards.md:0).
  - Ensure `ModeSelector` is designed to be injectable ([`docs/architecture.md:170`](docs/architecture.md:170)).
  - Use `async`/`await` for handling asynchronous prompt operations ([`docs/coding-standards.md:50`](docs/coding-standards.md:50)).
  - Use JSDoc comments for the `ModeSelector` class and its methods.

## Testing Requirements

**Guidance:** Verify implementation against the ACs using the following tests. Follow general testing approach in [`docs/testing-strategy.md`](docs/testing-strategy.md:0).

- **Unit Tests:**
    - Test `ModeSelector`'s logic for presenting categories and modes based on loaded definitions.
    - Test `ModeSelector`'s ability to correctly process mocked `enquirer` responses for single and multiple selections (AC1, AC2, AC3, AC4).
    - Test `ModeSelector`'s handling of the "no modes selected" case (AC5).
    - Use Vitest mocks (`vi.mock('enquirer')`) to simulate user input for prompts.
- **Integration Tests:**
    - Test the integration between `src/cli.ts` and `ModeSelector`, ensuring `cli.ts` correctly calls `ModeSelector` and passes necessary data when interactive mode is triggered.
- **Manual/CLI Verification:**
    - Run `pnpm install`.
    - Run `pnpm run build`.
    - Run `roo-init` and manually interact with the prompts to verify category and mode lists are displayed correctly and selections are captured (AC1, AC2, AC3, AC4).
    - Test the "no selection" case (AC5).

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [ ] Create [`src/core/ModeSelector.ts`](src/core/ModeSelector.ts:0) and implement the `ModeSelector` class.
- [ ] Implement methods in `ModeSelector` to handle category and mode selection prompts using `enquirer` via `UiManager`.
- [ ] Modify [`src/cli.ts`](src/cli.ts:0) to instantiate `ModeSelector` and call its interactive selection method when appropriate.
- [ ] Pass loaded definitions (from Story 1.3) and the `--force` flag state (from Story 2.1) to the `ModeSelector`.
- [ ] Implement logic in `ModeSelector` to return the list of selected mode slugs.
- [ ] Implement handling for the "no modes selected" case in `ModeSelector` or `src/cli.ts`.
- [ ] Create unit tests for `ModeSelector` in `tests/core/ModeSelector.test.ts` covering the ACs.
- [ ] Create integration tests covering the interaction between `src/cli.ts` and `ModeSelector`.
- [ ] Run `pnpm install` to ensure `enquirer` is installed.
- [ ] Run `pnpm run build` and `pnpm run test` to verify implementation and tests pass.
- [ ] Manually verify ACs using the `roo-init` command.
