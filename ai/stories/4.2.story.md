# Story 4.2: Implement `add custom mode` Command

**Status:** Draft

## Goal & Context

**User Story:** As a CLI User, I want an interactive command `roo-init manage add mode` to define a new custom mode, including its rules with content edited in-CLI, and save it to my global user configuration.

**Context:** This story builds upon Story 4.1, which established user-global storage and enhanced definition loading. It introduces the first CRUD (Create) operation for custom modes, allowing users to personalize their `roo-init` experience. This command will interactively guide the user through defining all aspects of a new mode, including its metadata and associated rule files (with content). The new mode will be saved to `~/.config/roo-init/user-definitions.json`, and its rule files to `~/.config/roo-init/rules/[mode_slug]/`. This is a key feature for user empowerment and extensibility of the CLI.

## Detailed Requirements

- Create the `roo-init manage add mode` command.
- Interactively prompt for:
    - `slug`: Must be unique among *other custom modes*. Validation needed.
    - `name`: Human-readable name for the mode.
    - `description` (`roleDefinition`): Detailed description of the mode.
    - `customInstructions` (optional): Specific instructions for the mode.
    - `groups` (optional, multi-select from a predefined list or allow freeform text input, TBD by dev agent - simpler is freeform comma-separated string for MVP, then parse into array).
    - `categorySlugs` (multi-select from existing system AND custom categories, loaded via `DefinitionLoader`).
- For `associatedRuleFiles`:
    - Repeatedly ask the user if they want to add a rule (e.g., "Add another rule? (y/N)").
    - If yes:
        - Prompt for rule `name` (human-readable display name).
        - Prompt for rule `filename` (e.g., `my-rule.md`). Validate for valid filename characters.
        - Prompt for rule `description` (optional, brief purpose).
        - Prompt for `isGeneric` (boolean, e.g., "Is this a generic rule (applies to .roo/rules/)? (y/N)", defaults to `false` meaning mode-specific).
        - Use an `inquirer` `editor` type prompt for the rule's Markdown content.
        - The `FileManager` service will handle saving the rule content to `~/.config/roo-init/rules/[mode_slug]/[filename]`. The `[mode_slug]` subdirectory under `~/.config/roo-init/rules/` must be created if it doesn't exist.
        - Store rule metadata (including `id` (can be derived from filename or be a UUID), `name`, `description`, `sourcePath`: `"[mode_slug]/[filename]"`, `isGeneric`) in the mode object being constructed. The `sourcePath` is relative to `~/.config/roo-init/rules/`.
- Save the complete new mode definition (as a `ModeDefinition` object) by appending it to the `customModes` array in `~/.config/roo-init/user-definitions.json`. If the file doesn't exist, it should be created with the appropriate structure (e.g., `{"customModes": [], "customCategories": []}`).

## Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

- AC1: User can successfully create a new custom mode with all its fields (slug, name, description, customInstructions, groups, categorySlugs) via interactive prompts.
- AC2: For each rule added to the custom mode:
    - User is prompted for rule metadata (name, filename, description, isGeneric).
    - User can input Markdown content using an editor prompt.
    - The rule's Markdown content is saved to `~/.config/roo-init/rules/[mode_slug]/[filename]`.
    - The `[mode_slug]` subdirectory under `~/.config/roo-init/rules/` is created if it doesn't already exist.
- AC3: The new mode definition, including metadata for all its associated rules (with correct `sourcePath`), is correctly appended to the `customModes` array in `~/.config/roo-init/user-definitions.json`.
- AC4: Input validation for the mode `slug` ensures it is unique among existing *custom mode slugs* (loaded via `DefinitionLoader`). If a duplicate custom slug is entered, an error is shown, and the user is re-prompted. Validation for rule `filename` ensures it's a valid filename.
- AC5: If `user-definitions.json` doesn't exist, it's created with the new mode. If it exists but is empty or malformed, appropriate error handling or initialization occurs before appending (e.g., initialize with `{"customModes": [], "customCategories": []}` if empty or unparsable).
- AC6: The command provides clear feedback to the user upon successful creation of the mode and its rules.

## Technical Implementation Context

**Guidance:** Use the following details for implementation. Developer agent is expected to follow project standards in [`docs/coding-standards.md`](docs/coding-standards.md:0) and understand the project structure in [`docs/project-structure.md`](docs/project-structure.md:0). Only story-specific details are included below.

- **Relevant Files:**
    - Files to Create:
        - `src/commands/manageAddMode.ts`: Handler for the `roo-init manage add mode` command.
        - `tests/commands/manageAddMode.test.ts`: Unit/integration tests for the command.
    - Files to Modify:
        - [`src/cli.ts`](src/cli.ts:0): To register the new `manage add mode` command with `commander`.
        - [`src/core/FileManager.ts`](src/core/FileManager.ts:0): To add methods for writing/updating `user-definitions.json` and saving custom rule files to the user-global storage, including creating `~/.config/roo-init/rules/[mode_slug]/` directories. Refer to [`docs/architecture.md:216`](docs/architecture.md:216).
        - [`src/utils/uiManager.ts`](src/utils/uiManager.ts:0): May need new reusable prompt sequences or to ensure `inquirer.prompt` (including `editor` type) is well-supported. Refer to [`docs/architecture.md:220`](docs/architecture.md:220).
        - [`src/types/domain.ts`](src/types/domain.ts:0): Ensure `Rule` interface includes `filename` if not already present, or clarify how `id` and `sourcePath` are derived/used for custom rules.
- **Key Technologies:**
    - `commander`: To define the `manage add mode` subcommand.
    - `inquirer`: For all interactive prompts, especially `input`, `checkbox` (for categories, groups if applicable), `confirm`, and `editor` types.
    - `fs-extra`: For reading/writing `user-definitions.json` and writing rule files to `~/.config/roo-init/rules/[mode_slug]/[filename]`.
    - `DefinitionLoader` ([`src/core/DefinitionLoader.ts`](src/core/DefinitionLoader.ts:0)): To load existing custom categories (for selection) and to check for custom mode slug uniqueness.
- **API Interactions / SDK Usage:**
    - `DefinitionLoader.getMergedDefinitions()`: To fetch existing categories and check custom mode slug uniqueness.
    - `FileManager.readUserDefinitions()` (new or existing): To get current custom modes/categories.
    - `FileManager.writeUserDefinitions(data)` (new): To save updated custom modes/categories.
    - `FileManager.saveCustomRuleFile(modeSlug, ruleFilename, content)` (new): To save rule content.
    - `inquirer.prompt([...questions])`: For all user interactions.
- **UI/UX Notes:**
    - Prompts should be clear and guide the user step-by-step.
    - Provide defaults where sensible (e.g., `isGeneric: false` for rules).
    - The `editor` prompt should launch the system's default editor or a basic in-terminal editor.
- **Data Structures:**
    - `ModeDefinition`, `CategoryDefinition`, `Rule` from [`docs/data-models.md`](docs/data-models.md:0).
    - The `Rule` object stored in `ModeDefinition.associatedRuleFiles` for a custom rule should have `sourcePath` like `"[mode_slug]/[filename]"` and `isGeneric` set by user. `id` could be derived from `filename` (e.g., `filename` without `.md`).
- **Environment Variables:**
    - None. Refer to [`docs/environment-vars.md`](docs/environment-vars.md:0).
- **Coding Standards Notes:**
    - Modularize prompt sequences if they become complex.
    - Ensure robust error handling for file operations and input validation.
    - Use `async/await` for all asynchronous operations (prompts, file I/O).

## Testing Requirements

**Guidance:** Verify implementation against the ACs using the following tests. Follow general testing approach in [`docs/testing-strategy.md`](docs/testing-strategy.md:0).

- **Unit Tests:**
    - `manageAddMode.ts` command handler:
        - Mock `inquirer` to simulate user inputs for various scenarios (all fields filled, optional fields skipped, adding multiple rules, adding no rules).
        - Mock `DefinitionLoader` to provide existing categories and existing custom mode slugs for uniqueness checks.
        - Mock `FileManager` to verify it's called with correct data to save mode definition and rule files.
        - Test input validation logic (e.g., for duplicate custom slug, invalid rule filename).
- **Integration Tests:**
    - Test the `manage add mode` command by running it programmatically (if feasible for `commander` setup) with mocked `inquirer`.
    - Verify interaction with actual (or heavily mocked) `DefinitionLoader` and `FileManager`.
    - Test the file system operations in a temporary user-global config directory:
        - `user-definitions.json` is created/updated correctly.
        - Rule files are created in `~/.config/roo-init/rules/[mode_slug]/` with correct content.
- **Manual/CLI Verification (Essential for `editor` prompt):**
    - Run `roo-init manage add mode` interactively.
    - Provide inputs for all fields.
    - Add at least two rules, one generic, one specific, using the editor prompt for content.
    - Verify `user-definitions.json` in `~/.config/roo-init/` is updated correctly.
    - Verify rule files are created in `~/.config/roo-init/rules/[mode_slug]/` with the content entered in the editor.
    - Test slug uniqueness validation by trying to add a mode with an existing custom slug.
    - Test adding a mode when `user-definitions.json` does not exist.
