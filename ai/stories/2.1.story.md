# Story 2.1: Implement Interactive Mode Trigger and Basic Flow

**Status:** Draft

## Goal & Context

**User Story:** As a Developer, when I run `roo-init`, I want the CLI to enter an interactive mode to guide me through the setup process, while also allowing a `--force` flag to overwrite existing files.

**Context:** This story builds upon the basic project setup (Story 1.1) and argument parsing (Story 1.2) established in Epic 1. It introduces the interactive mode as the default behavior when no specific commands like `--help` or `--version` are provided. It also incorporates the `--force` flag, which will be used in later stories to control file overwriting behavior. This is the first step in implementing the core interactive workflow defined in Epic 2 ([`docs/epic2.md`](docs/epic2.md:3)).

## Detailed Requirements

- Modify the argument parsing logic (from Epic 1) to handle the `--force` flag and trigger interactive mode by default unless `--help` or `--version` is specified.
- When interactive mode is triggered, initiate the prompting sequence (starting with category/mode selection).
- Integrate an interactive prompt library (e.g., `inquirer`).
- Make the state of the `--force` flag available to subsequent file operation steps.

## Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

- AC1: Running `roo-init` triggers the interactive prompt sequence.
- AC2: Running `roo-init --help` or `roo-init --version` does *not* trigger the interactive mode.
- AC3: Running `roo-init --force` triggers the interactive prompt sequence and registers the force flag internally.
- AC4: The chosen interactive prompt library is added as a dependency and integrated.

## Technical Implementation Context

**Guidance:** Use the following details for implementation. Developer agent is expected to follow project standards in [`docs/coding-standards.md`](docs/coding-standards.md:0) and understand the project structure in [`docs/project-structure.md`](docs/project-structure.md:0). Only story-specific details are included below.

- **Relevant Files:**

  - Files to Modify:
    - [`src/cli.ts`](src/cli.ts:0): This file is the main entry point where `commander` is configured. The logic for handling the `--force` flag and determining whether to enter interactive mode will be added here.

- **Key Technologies:**

  - Node.js (`^20.12.0` as per [`docs/tech-stack.md`](docs/tech-stack.md:8))
  - TypeScript (`^5.4.5` as per [`docs/tech-stack.md`](docs/tech-stack.md:11))
  - pnpm (`^9.1.0` as per [`docs/tech-stack.md`](docs/tech-stack.md:16))
  - `commander` (`^17.7.2` as per [`docs/tech-stack.md`](docs/tech-stack.md:21)): Used for argument parsing.
  - `enquirer` (`^2.4.1` as per [`docs/tech-stack.md`](docs/tech-stack.md:26)): The chosen library for interactive prompts. This needs to be added as a project dependency.

- **API Interactions / SDK Usage:**

  - N/A for this story.

- **UI/UX Notes:**

  - The interactive prompt sequence will be initiated by this story, but the actual prompts for category/mode selection will be implemented in Story 2.2.

- **Data Structures:**

  - N/A for this story.

- **Environment Variables:**

  - None required for this story ([`docs/environment-vars.md`](docs/environment-vars.md:7)).

- **Coding Standards Notes:**

  - Follow standards defined in [`docs/coding-standards.md`](docs/coding-standards.md:0).
  - Ensure `commander` configuration in [`src/cli.ts`](src/cli.ts:0) is clear and handles the new `--force` flag correctly.
  - Use `async`/`await` for handling asynchronous operations related to interactive prompts ([`docs/coding-standards.md:50`](docs/coding-standards.md:50)).

## Testing Requirements

**Guidance:** Verify implementation against the ACs using the following tests. Follow general testing approach in [`docs/testing-strategy.md`](docs/testing-strategy.md:0).

- **Unit Tests:**
    - No specific unit tests are required for this story as the core logic is handled by `commander` and the focus is on integration with the CLI entry point.
- **Integration Tests:**
    - N/A for this story.
- **Manual/CLI Verification:**
    - Ensure the project is built (`pnpm run build`) and linked (`pnpm link --global`) after implementing this story.
    - Run `roo-init` and verify that an interactive prompt sequence begins (AC1).
    - Run `roo-init --help` and verify that the help text is displayed and interactive mode is *not* triggered (AC2).
    - Run `roo-init --version` and verify that the version is displayed and interactive mode is *not* triggered (AC2).
    - Run `roo-init --force` and verify that an interactive prompt sequence begins (AC3). (Internal verification of the flag being registered will be part of later stories' tests).

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [ ] Add `enquirer` as a project dependency (`pnpm add enquirer`).
- [ ] Modify [`src/cli.ts`](src/cli.ts:0) to add the `--force` option to the main command using `commander`.
- [ ] Implement logic in [`src/cli.ts`](src/cli.ts:0) to check for the presence of `--help` or `--version` flags. If neither is present, trigger the interactive mode flow.
- [ ] Implement a placeholder function or call in [`src/cli.ts`](src/cli.ts:0) to represent the start of the interactive prompt sequence (this will be expanded in Story 2.2).
- [ ] Ensure the state of the `--force` flag is captured and can be passed to subsequent logic (e.g., via command options object).
- [ ] Run `pnpm install` to install the new dependency.
- [ ] Run `pnpm run build` to compile changes.
- [ ] Manually verify ACs using the `roo-init` command in the terminal.
