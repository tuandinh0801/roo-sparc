# Story 4.4: Implement `list custom modes` and `list custom categories` Commands

**Status:** Draft

## Goal & Context

**User Story:** As a CLI User, I want commands to list my custom modes and categories, and optionally all system definitions too, so I can review my configurations and available options.

**Context:** This story provides the "Read" capability for custom modes and categories, complementing the "Create" functions from Stories 4.2 and 4.3. It allows users to view the definitions they've created and also to see how they integrate with or override system definitions. This is crucial for managing custom configurations and understanding the full set of available modes/categories. It relies on the `DefinitionLoader`'s enhanced capability (from Story 4.1) to provide merged lists of system and custom definitions.

## Detailed Requirements

- Create the `roo-init manage list modes` command.
- Create the `roo-init manage list categories` command.
- Both commands should support an optional `--source` flag with the following possible values:
    - `custom` (default if flag is omitted): Lists only user-defined custom modes/categories from `~/.config/roo-init/user-definitions.json`.
    - `system`: Lists only the bundled system modes/categories.
    - `all`: Lists all modes/categories, merging system and custom definitions. When a custom definition's slug conflicts with a system definition's slug, only the custom definition (which takes precedence) should be shown, but it should be clearly marked as `(custom, overrides system)` or similar. Non-conflicting custom definitions should be marked `(custom)`. System definitions should be marked `(system)`.
- The output for each listed item (mode or category) should include at least:
    - `slug`
    - `name`
    - `description`
    - `source` (indicating if it's 'system', 'custom', or 'custom (overrides system)' when `--source=all`)
- The output should be presented in a clear, readable format, preferably using a table (e.g., via `cli-table3` integrated into `UiManager`).

## Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

- AC1: Running `roo-init manage list modes` (or `roo-init manage list modes --source=custom`) displays only custom modes from `user-definitions.json` in a table format, including slug, name, description, and source ('custom').
- AC2: Running `roo-init manage list modes --source=system` displays only system (bundled) modes in a table format, including slug, name, description, and source ('system').
- AC3: Running `roo-init manage list modes --source=all` displays a merged list.
    - Custom modes overriding system modes are shown once (the custom version) and marked appropriately (e.g., source: 'custom (overrides system)').
    - Non-conflicting custom modes are marked (e.g., source: 'custom').
    - System modes not overridden are marked (e.g., source: 'system').
- AC4: Similar behavior (AC1-AC3) is implemented for `roo-init manage list categories` and its `--source` flag options.
- AC5: If no definitions of the specified type/source exist (e.g., `list modes --source=custom` when no custom modes are defined), a clear message like "No custom modes found." is displayed.
- AC6: The output table is well-formatted and easy to read.

## Technical Implementation Context

**Guidance:** Use the following details for implementation. Developer agent is expected to follow project standards in [`docs/coding-standards.md`](docs/coding-standards.md:0) and understand the project structure in [`docs/project-structure.md`](docs/project-structure.md:0). Only story-specific details are included below.

- **Relevant Files:**
    - Files to Create:
        - `src/commands/manageListModes.ts`
        - `src/commands/manageListCategories.ts`
        - `tests/commands/manageListModes.test.ts`
        - `tests/commands/manageListCategories.test.ts`
    - Files to Modify:
        - [`src/cli.ts`](src/cli.ts:0): To register the new `manage list modes` and `manage list categories` commands.
        - [`src/utils/uiManager.ts`](src/utils/uiManager.ts:0): To add or enhance a generic table display utility using `cli-table3` if not already sufficiently capable. Refer to [`docs/architecture.md:96`](docs/architecture.md:96).
        - [`src/core/DefinitionLoader.ts`](src/core/DefinitionLoader.ts:0): May need methods to easily distinguish or retrieve system-only, custom-only, or fully merged (with precedence and source tagging) lists of definitions.
- **Key Technologies:**
    - `commander`: For command and option parsing.
    - `DefinitionLoader` ([`src/core/DefinitionLoader.ts`](src/core/DefinitionLoader.ts:0)): Central to fetching the definitions.
    - `cli-table3` (via `UiManager`): For displaying the output.
- **API Interactions / SDK Usage:**
    - `DefinitionLoader.getSystemDefinitions()` (or similar, new/existing).
    - `DefinitionLoader.getCustomDefinitions()` (or similar, new/existing).
    - `DefinitionLoader.getMergedDefinitions()` (enhanced to provide source information or allow filtering).
    - `UiManager.displayTable(headers, rows)` (or similar).
- **UI/UX Notes:**
    - Table columns should be well-aligned.
    - Ensure the "source" indication is clear and unambiguous.
- **Data Structures:**
    - `ModeDefinition`, `CategoryDefinition` from [`docs/data-models.md`](docs/data-models.md:0). The `DefinitionLoader` might augment these with a temporary `sourceType: 'system' | 'custom' | 'custom-override'` when providing data for the `all` view.
- **Environment Variables:**
    - None.
- **Coding Standards Notes:**
    - Logic for filtering and preparing data for the table should be clean and testable.

## Testing Requirements

**Guidance:** Verify implementation against the ACs using the following tests. Follow general testing approach in [`docs/testing-strategy.md`](docs/testing-strategy.md:0).

- **Unit Tests:**
    - `manageListModes.ts` / `manageListCategories.ts` command handlers:
        - Mock `DefinitionLoader` to return various sets of system/custom/merged definitions.
        - Verify that the correct data is passed to `UiManager.displayTable`.
        - Test logic for handling the `--source` flag.
        - Test "no definitions found" message.
    - `DefinitionLoader` (if new methods added):
        - Test new methods for returning filtered/tagged definition lists.
- **Integration Tests:**
    - Test command handlers with a real (or more deeply integrated mock) `DefinitionLoader` and `UiManager`.
    - Set up temporary global `user-definitions.json` with various scenarios (no custom, some custom, custom overriding system) and verify the console output (mock or spy `console.log` used by `UiManager`'s table).
- **Manual/CLI Verification:**
    - Run `roo-init manage list modes` and `roo-init manage list categories` with all `--source` options (`custom`, `system`, `all`, and default).
    - Verify against known system definitions and manually created custom definitions in `~/.config/roo-init/user-definitions.json`.
    - Check table formatting and clarity of "source" information.
    - Test with no custom definitions present.

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [ ] **Setup List Commands:**
    - [ ] In [`src/cli.ts`](src/cli.ts:0), add `list modes` and `list categories` as subcommands to `manage`.
    - [ ] Create `src/commands/manageListModes.ts` and `src/commands/manageListCategories.ts` with basic handler structure and `--source` option.
- [ ] **Enhance `DefinitionLoader` (if needed):**
    - [ ] Add methods to `DefinitionLoader` to easily retrieve:
        - Only system definitions.
        - Only custom definitions.
        - A merged list where each item is tagged with its source (`system`, `custom`, `custom-override`).
- [ ] **Implement Command Logic:**
    - [ ] In `manageListModes.ts`:
        - Call appropriate `DefinitionLoader` method based on `--source` flag.
        - Format data (slug, name, description, source tag) for table display.
        - Call `UiManager` to display the table or "not found" message.
    - [ ] In `manageListCategories.ts`:
        - Similar logic as for modes.
- [ ] **Enhance `UiManager` (if needed):**
    - [ ] Ensure `UiManager` has a robust method to display data in a formatted table using `cli-table3`.
- [ ] **Unit & Integration Tests:**
    - [ ] Write unit tests for command handlers and any new `DefinitionLoader` logic.
    - [ ] Write integration tests verifying output with different `user-definitions.json` states.
- [ ] **Documentation:**
    - [ ] Add JSDoc for new command handlers.
    - [ ] Update user guide/CLI reference.
