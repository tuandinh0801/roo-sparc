# Story T1.1: Migrate Interactive Prompts from `enquirer` to `inquirer`

**Status:** Draft

## Goal & Context

**User Story:** As a Developer, I want the CLI to standardize on the `inquirer` library for all interactive prompts, replacing any previous considerations or remnants of the `enquirer` library, to ensure consistency and leverage `inquirer`'s full feature set, including the `editor` prompt.

**Context:** This story addresses the technical decision to use `inquirer` as the sole library for interactive command-line prompts, as documented in [`docs/tech-stack.md:25`](docs/tech-stack.md:25) and reflected in the v0.3 update of [`docs/architecture.md:279`](docs/architecture.md:279) (which superseded a v0.2 mention of `enquirer`). This migration/standardization is crucial for consistency and to fully utilize `inquirer`'s capabilities, particularly the `editor` prompt type needed for Epic 4's custom mode and rule management features. This story ensures the codebase aligns with this final architectural choice.

## Detailed Requirements

- Remove any `enquirer` dependency if it was ever added to `package.json`.
- Confirm the `inquirer` dependency (version `^9.2.20` or as specified in [`docs/tech-stack.md:26`](docs/tech-stack.md:26)) is correctly listed in `package.json`.
- Refactor any code that might have been intended for or used `enquirer` to exclusively use `inquirer` for all interactive prompts.
    - This primarily impacts [`src/utils/uiManager.ts`](src/utils/uiManager.ts:0), which should be the central module for all `inquirer` interactions.
    - Ensure common prompt types (input, list, checkbox, confirm, password, etc.) are implemented using `inquirer` via `UiManager`.
- Specifically integrate and expose `inquirer`'s `editor` prompt type through `UiManager`. This functionality is critical for Epic 4 commands like `manage add mode` and `manage edit mode` for in-CLI editing of Markdown rule content.
- Review and update all unit tests, integration tests, and E2E tests that mock or interact with the prompt mechanism to reflect the exclusive use of `inquirer`.
- Verify that all existing and planned CLI interactions requiring prompts (e.g., `roo-init` interactive mode, all `roo-init manage` subcommands) are designed to use `inquirer` via `UiManager`.

## Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

- AC1: The `enquirer` dependency is confirmed to be absent from `package.json` and `pnpm-lock.yaml`.
- AC2: The `inquirer` dependency (version `^9.2.20` or as specified in [`docs/tech-stack.md:26`](docs/tech-stack.md:26)) is correctly listed in `package.json` and `pnpm-lock.yaml`.
- AC3: The [`src/utils/uiManager.ts`](src/utils/uiManager.ts:0) module exclusively uses `inquirer` for all its interactive prompt functionalities.
- AC4: The `UiManager` successfully provides access to `inquirer`'s `editor` prompt type, and this is usable by command handlers.
- AC5: All existing interactive CLI flows (e.g., mode selection in `roo-init`) function correctly using `inquirer` through `UiManager`.
- AC6: All tests involving interactive prompts are updated to work with `inquirer`'s API (or `UiManager`'s abstraction of it) and pass.
- AC7: The [`docs/tech-stack.md`](docs/tech-stack.md:25) correctly reflects `inquirer` as the chosen interactive prompt library (this is a confirmation, as the doc is already up-to-date).
- AC8: Any internal developer notes or old comments referencing `enquirer` are updated or removed.

## Technical Implementation Context

**Guidance:** Use the following details for implementation. Developer agent is expected to follow project standards in [`docs/coding-standards.md`](docs/coding-standards.md:0) and understand the project structure in [`docs/project-structure.md`](docs/project-structure.md:0). Only story-specific details are included below.

- **Relevant Files:**
    - Files to Modify:
        - [`package.json`](package.json:0): Ensure `enquirer` is not present, `inquirer` is present with the correct version.
        - [`pnpm-lock.yaml`](pnpm-lock.yaml:0): Will be updated by `pnpm install`.
        - [`src/utils/uiManager.ts`](src/utils/uiManager.ts:0): Central place for `inquirer` integration. Ensure it wraps various `inquirer` prompt types, including `editor`.
        - All command handlers in `src/commands/` that use interactive prompts (e.g., `init.ts`, `manageAddMode.ts`, `manageEditMode.ts`, etc.): Ensure they use `UiManager` for prompts.
        - Test files in `tests/` that involve prompt mocking or interaction.
    - Files to Check for `enquirer` mentions: Any code or documentation file.
- **Key Technologies:**
    - `inquirer` (version `^9.2.20` or as per [`docs/tech-stack.md:26`](docs/tech-stack.md:26))
    - [`src/utils/uiManager.ts`](src/utils/uiManager.ts:0) as the abstraction layer.
- **API Interactions / SDK Usage:**
    - `inquirer.prompt()` and its various question object configurations (type: `input`, `list`, `checkbox`, `confirm`, `editor`, etc.).
- **Data Structures:**
    - N/A directly, but prompt configurations for `inquirer` are key.
- **Environment Variables:**
    - N/A
- **Coding Standards Notes:**
    - Ensure `UiManager` provides a clean and consistent interface for using different prompt types.
    - JSDoc for `UiManager` methods related to prompts should be clear.

## Testing Requirements

**Guidance:** Verify implementation against the ACs using the following tests. Follow general testing approach in [`docs/testing-strategy.md`](docs/testing-strategy.md:0).

- **Unit Tests:**
    - For [`src/utils/uiManager.ts`](src/utils/uiManager.ts:0):
        - Test that methods correctly call `inquirer.prompt` with appropriate question objects for each supported prompt type (input, list, checkbox, confirm, editor).
        - Mock `inquirer.prompt` to verify arguments and return values.
    - For command handlers:
        - Mock `UiManager`'s prompt methods to simulate user input and verify command logic based on different inputs.
- **Integration Tests:**
    - Test command handlers interacting with a real (or lightly mocked) `UiManager` that uses `inquirer`.
    - Focus on the flow of data from prompts into command logic.
- **E2E Tests (as applicable):**
    - Existing E2E tests involving interactive prompts must pass after the migration/standardization.
    - New E2E tests for Epic 4 features (like `manage add mode` using the `editor` prompt) will inherently test this `inquirer` integration.
- **Manual/CLI Verification:**
    - Manually run through all interactive flows of the CLI:
        - `roo-init` (default interactive mode for mode/category selection).
        - All `roo-init manage` subcommands that involve prompts (add, edit for modes/categories).
    - Pay special attention to the `editor` prompt functionality when adding/editing custom rules.
    - Verify that prompt behavior is consistent and user-friendly.

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [ ] **Refactor/Implement `UiManager`:**
    - [ ] Review [`src/utils/uiManager.ts`](src/utils/uiManager.ts:0).
    - [ ] Ensure all prompt functionalities are implemented using `inquirer`.
    - [ ] Add a specific, well-defined method for using the `editor` prompt type from `inquirer`.
    - [ ] Ensure other prompt types (input, list, checkbox, confirm) are robustly wrapped.
- [ ] **Update Command Handlers:**
    - [ ] Review all command handlers in `src/commands/` that use prompts.
