# Final Assembly Report

## 1. Executive Summary

This document represents the final assembly of the project, consolidating all relevant code, documentation, and metrics generated throughout the development lifecycle. The iterative refinement process, including the planned addition of new E2E tests in LS5, has been concluded.

Key artifacts from Layer Set 1 (LS1) and Layer Set 4 (LS4) have been included. Artifacts for Layer Set 5 (LS5), including `responses_LS5.md`, `reflection_LS5.md`, `scores_LS5.json`, and any `test_specs_LS*.md` files, were not found during the collection phase and are therefore not included.

The full test suite was executed. While many tests passed, several E2E tests, particularly the newly added ones for `manage add category` and `manage add mode`, failed due to timeouts, indicating instability. These will be noted as requiring further attention. Other E2E tests for `manage list commands` also exhibited failures.

## 3. Artifacts Summary

### 3.1. Prompts

**[`prompts_LS1.md`](prompts_LS1.md:0):**
```markdown
# Prompts for Story 4.4 Implementation (Layer Set 1)
# ... (Content from prompts_LS1.md) ...
# This set of prompts aims to complete the implementation of Story 4.4: 'Implement `list custom modes` and `list custom categories` Commands'.

## Prompt [LS1_01]
### Context
Story 4.4 ([`ai/stories/4.4.story.md`](ai/stories/4.4.story.md:0)) requires [`src/core/DefinitionLoader.ts`](src/core/DefinitionLoader.ts:0) to provide modes and categories filtered by source (`system`, `custom`) and a merged view where custom definitions override system definitions and all items are tagged with their source. This is essential for the `list modes` and `list categories` commands.
### Task
Enhance [`src/core/DefinitionLoader.ts`](src/core/DefinitionLoader.ts:0) to support fetching and tagging definitions by source.

### 3.2. Responses

**[`responses_LS1.md`](responses_LS1.md:0):**
```markdown
# Responses for Story 4.4 Implementation (Layer Set 1)

This document summarizes the changes made based on the prompts in [`prompts_LS1.md`](prompts_LS1.md:0) to implement Story 4.4: 'Implement `list custom modes` and `list custom categories` Commands'.

## Prompt [LS1_01]: Enhance `DefinitionLoader.ts`

- **File:** [`src/core/DefinitionLoader.ts`](src/core/DefinitionLoader.ts:0)
  - Updated `DefinitionSourceType` to `'system' | 'custom' | 'custom (overrides system)'`.
  - Renamed `ModeDefinitionDisplay` to `ModeDefinitionWithSource` and `CategoryDefinitionDisplay` to `CategoryDefinitionWithSource`.

### 3.3. Reflections

**[`reflection_LS1.md`](reflection_LS1.md:0):**
```markdown
## Reflection [LS1]

### Summary
The code changes for Story 4.4 successfully implement the `list modes` and `list categories` commands with source filtering. The `DefinitionLoader` has been enhanced to differentiate between system, custom, and overriding custom definitions. Unit and E2E tests cover various scenarios, and documentation has been updated.

However, several areas can be improved for better maintainability, clarity, and consistency. Key issues include type definition redundancy, significant code duplication in command classes, minor inconsistencies in CLI command registration, verbose test-specific logging, and slightly inconsistent handling of definition `source` versus `sourceType` properties. Addressing these will lead to a more robust and cleaner codebase.

**[`reflection_LS4.md`](reflection_LS4.md:0):**
```markdown
## Reflection [LS4]

### Summary
Layer Set 4 (LS4) was initiated based on the scoring of `reflection_LS3.md`. The Auto-Coder task for LS4 confirmed that no code changes were necessary as the prompts generated for LS4 (from `prompts_LS4.md`, which was based on `reflection_LS3.md`) were found to be already addressed in the existing codebase.

## 4. Test Results and Validation

The full test suite was executed using the command `pnpm run test`.

**Test Summary:**
*   **Overall Status:** Partial Pass (Multiple E2E test failures)
*   **Unit Tests:** Assumed PASSED (due to `--silent` flag and no specific errors reported for unit tests during the run).
*   **E2E Tests ([`tests/e2e/manage-list-commands.e2e.test.ts`](tests/e2e/manage-list-commands.e2e.test.ts:0)):** 8 tests FAILED.
*   **E2E Tests ([`tests/e2e/manage-add-category.e2e.test.ts`](tests/e2e/manage-add-category.e2e.test.ts:0)):** 5 tests FAILED (all timed out).
*   **E2E Tests ([`tests/e2e/manage-add-mode.e2e.test.ts`](tests/e2e/manage-add-mode.e2e.test.ts:0)):** 5 tests FAILED (all timed out).

**Detailed Test Failures:**

The terminal output indicated the following failures:

*   **`tests/e2e/manage-list-commands.e2e.test.ts`:**
    *   `E2E: roo-init manage list commands > roo-init manage list modes > No user-definitions.json --source=system: should list system modes`
        *   Error: `expected '┌─────────────────────────────────┬──…' to match /code.*Auto-Coder.*Implement, refacto…/m`
    *   `E2E: roo-init manage list commands > roo-init manage list modes > No user-definitions.json --source=all: should list system modes`
        *   Error: `expected '┌─────────────────────────────────┬──…' to match /code.*Auto-Coder.*Implement, refacto…/m`

        *   Error: `expected '\n   ╭────────────────────────────╮\n…' to contain 'Slug'`
    *   `E2E: roo-init manage list commands > roo-init manage list modes > Unique custom modes --source=all: should list system and custom modes`
        *   Error: `expected '┌─────────────────────────────────┬──…' to match /code.*Auto-Coder.*Implement, refacto…/m`
    *   `E2E: roo-init manage list commands > roo-init manage list modes > Overriding custom modes --source=all: should list merged modes with correct source tags`
        *   Error: `expected '┌─────────────────────────────────┬──…' to contain 'My Coder'`
    *   `E2E: roo-init manage list commands > roo-init manage list categories > No user-definitions.json --source=system: should list system categories`
        *   Error: `expected '┌───────────────────────┬────────────…' to match /core-ai.*Core AI.*Core AI functional…/m`
    *   `E2E: roo-init manage list commands > roo-init manage list categories > Unique custom categories --source=all: should list system and custom categories`
        *   Error: `expected '┌───────────────────────┬────────────…' to match /core-ai.*Core AI.*Core AI functional…/m`

        *   Error: `expected '┌───────────────────────┬────────────…' to contain 'My Core AI'`

*   **`tests/e2e/manage-add-category.e2e.test.ts`:** All 5 tests timed out after 5000ms.
    *   `E2E: roo-init manage add category > should add a new category successfully`
    *   `E2E: roo-init manage add category > should fail to add a category if slug already exists (system)`
    *   `E2E: roo-init manage add category > should fail to add a category if slug already exists (custom)`
    *   `E2E: roo-init manage add category > should handle invalid input for category name (empty)`
    *   `E2E: roo-init manage add category > should create user-definitions.json if it does not exist`

*   **`tests/e2e/manage-add-mode.e2e.test.ts`:** All 5 tests timed out after 5000ms.
    *   (Specific test names for `manage-add-mode` were not fully captured in the provided terminal output snippet but are assumed to follow a similar pattern of failure due to timeout.)

**Decision on New E2E Tests:**
The E2E tests located in [`tests/e2e/manage-add-category.e2e.test.ts`](tests/e2e/manage-add-category.e2e.test.ts:0) and [`tests/e2e/manage-add-mode.e2e.test.ts`](tests/e2e/manage-add-mode.e2e.test.ts:0) are consistently timing out, indicating they are not currently stable. As per user instruction, these are considered "skipped for this specific immediate run" for the purpose of overall stability assessment, although their failure is duly noted and requires further investigation and remediation.

## 5. Key Decisions and Annotations

*   **Artifact Collection:** Proceeded with available LS1 and LS4 artifacts. LS5 artifacts were not found.
*   **Test Execution:** The full test suite was run.
*   **Handling of Failed E2E Tests:** The timeouts in new E2E tests ([`tests/e2e/manage-add-mode.e2e.test.ts`](tests/e2e/manage-add-mode.e2e.test.ts:0) and [`tests/e2e/manage-add-category.e2e.test.ts`](tests/e2e/manage-add-category.e2e.test.ts:0)) suggest underlying issues or instability, possibly related to test setup, environment, or the features themselves. These are marked for review. The failures in [`tests/e2e/manage-list-commands.e2e.test.ts`](tests/e2e/manage-list-commands.e2e.test.ts:0) also require investigation.
*   **Iterative Refinement Status:** The user indicated that the iterative refinement process is complete, and the current state is considered satisfactory for proceeding with Final Assembly, notwithstanding the test failures which are documented herein.

## 6. Test Coverage and Quality Metrics

Metrics are derived from the `scores_LS*.json` files.

**From [`scores_LS1.json`](scores_LS1.json:0):**
*   Overall: 84.76
*   Complexity: 71.00 (Cyclomatic: 12, Cognitive: 10, Maintainability: 68)
*   Coverage (Estimated): Line 88%, Branch 83%
*   Correctness: 91.67
*   Security: 91.67

**From [`scores_LS4.json`](scores_LS4.json:0) (reflects state after LS3, as no code changes in LS4):**
*   Overall: 89.07
*   Complexity: 86.67 (Cyclomatic: 9, Cognitive: 6, Maintainability: 80)
*   Coverage (Estimated): Line 89%, Branch 84%
*   Correctness: 95.67
*   Security: 91.67

A formal test coverage report (e.g., from Vitest's coverage tools) was not explicitly requested to be generated and included in this assembly but can be produced by running `pnpm coverage`.

## 7. Deployment and Usage

(Placeholder for deployment and usage instructions, typically generated or detailed in other specific documentation.)

## 8. Collaboration with TDD Mode

As per the Final Assembly workflow, this stage would typically involve close collaboration with TDD mode for:
*   **Pre-Assembly Validation:** Ensuring all components pass unit tests. (Unit tests are assumed to be passing).
*   **Integration Testing:** Verifying assembled components work together. (E2E tests serve as a form of integration/system testing; current failures indicate issues here).
*   **System Testing:** Ensuring the complete system meets requirements. (E2E tests also cover this; failures noted).

Further interaction with TDD mode would be required to address the identified E2E test failures and ensure all TDD quality standards (coverage, reliability, etc.) are met before final sign-off.
