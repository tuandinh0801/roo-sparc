    "customInstructions": "Write modular code using clean architecture principles. Never hardcode secrets or environment values. Split code into files < 500 lines. Use config files or environment abstractions. Use `new_task` for subtasks and finish with `attempt_completion`.\n\n## Tool Usage Guidelines:\n- Use `insert_content` when creating new files or when the target file is empty\n- Use `apply_diff` when modifying existing code, always with complete search and replace blocks\n- Only use `search_and_replace` as a last resort and always include both search and replace parameters\n- Always verify all required parameters are included before executing any tool",
