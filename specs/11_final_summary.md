# Node.js CLI Tool - Final Specification Summary

## Project Overview

This specification defines a Node.js Command Line Interface (CLI) tool that allows developers to efficiently manage workflows and modes in a development environment. The tool enables seamless selection, creation, and customization of workflows, with capabilities for copying definitions and rules between modes.

## Core Components

The system architecture consists of these primary components:

1. **CLI Interface Layer**: Provides command parsing, help documentation, and interactive prompts
2. **Workflow Manager**: Handles workflow selection, creation, and management
3. **Mode Handler**: Manages individual modes within workflows
4. **Definition & Rules Engine**: Manages copying, validation, and transformation of definitions and rules
5. **File System Interface**: Handles reading/writing configuration files and rules
6. **Configuration Manager**: Manages user preferences and default settings

## Key Functional Requirements

### 1. Workflow Management
- Select existing workflows via interactive prompts or direct commands
- Create new workflows with customizable templates
- Copy workflows with optional modifications
- Delete workflows with proper validation
- List available workflows with relevant metadata

### 2. Mode Selection & Configuration
- Select modes within workflows via interactive menu
- Configure mode-specific settings and parameters
- Enable cross-workflow mode selection
- Switch between modes with state preservation

### 3. Definition & Rules Handling
- Copy definitions between modes and workflows
- Validate rule syntax and structure
- Transform rules between different formats
- Merge rules with conflict resolution
- Export/import rules to external formats

### 4. User Experience
- Interactive command prompts with auto-completion
- Rich help documentation with examples
- Color-coded terminal output
- Progress indicators for long-running operations
- Error messages with actionable suggestions

### 5. Configuration & Customization
- User-configurable defaults and preferences
- Support for configuration profiles
- Environment-specific settings
- Extensible plugin architecture

## Edge Cases & Constraints

### Edge Cases
1. **Naming Conflicts**: System detects and handles duplicate workflow/mode names
2. **Broken Configurations**: Tool can recover from corrupt configuration files
3. **Partial Operations**: Handles interruptions during copy/transform operations
4. **Permission Issues**: Provides clear guidance when file permissions prevent operations
5. **Large Rule Sets**: Efficiently processes very large rule collections without memory issues

### Constraints
1. **Node.js Environment**: Requires Node.js v14.x or higher
2. **File System Access**: Needs read/write permissions in workflow directories
3. **Terminal Capabilities**: Requires terminal with support for ANSI colors and interactive input
4. **Response Time**: All interactive commands must complete within 500ms
5. **Backward Compatibility**: Must maintain compatibility with existing workflow formats

## Error Handling Strategy

1. **Validation First**: Preemptively validate inputs before operations
2. **Graceful Degradation**: Fall back to simpler functionality when advanced features fail
3. **Detailed Error Messages**: Provide context-specific error information with resolution steps
4. **Transaction Safety**: Roll back partial operations when complete success cannot be guaranteed
5. **Logging**: Maintain error logs with sufficient context for troubleshooting

## Performance Considerations

1. **Lazy Loading**: Load workflow data only when needed
2. **Caching**: Cache frequently accessed configurations and rule definitions
3. **Parallel Processing**: Utilize worker threads for CPU-intensive rule transformations
4. **Memory Management**: Stream large files rather than loading entirely into memory
5. **Startup Time**: CLI must initialize in under 300ms for critical commands

## Testing Strategy

### Test Categories
1. **Unit Tests**: For individual component functionality
2. **Integration Tests**: For component interaction
3. **E2E Tests**: For complete workflow scenarios
4. **Performance Tests**: For response time validation
5. **Edge Case Tests**: For handling unusual conditions

### TDD Anchors
- `// TEST: CLI correctly parses workflow selection commands`
- `// TEST: Interactive mode displays all available workflows`
- `// TEST: Workflow creation validates name uniqueness`
- `// TEST: Rules are correctly copied between modes`
- `// TEST: Error is shown when target mode doesn't exist`
- `// TEST: Configuration changes persist between sessions`
- `// TEST: Large rule sets are processed without memory errors`
- `// TEST: CLI handles interrupted operations gracefully`
- `// TEST: Cross-workflow mode selection maintains context`
- `// TEST: Help command shows comprehensive documentation`

## Acceptance Criteria

1. **Workflow Management**
   - Users can create, select, modify, and delete workflows
   - Workflow operations preserve data integrity
   - All workflow metadata is correctly maintained

2. **Mode Handling**
   - All modes within workflows are accessible
   - Mode-specific configurations can be customized
   - Cross-workflow mode selection works seamlessly

3. **Definition & Rules**
   - Rules can be copied between any compatible modes
   - Rule validation prevents invalid configurations
   - Rule transformations maintain semantic equivalence

4. **User Experience**
   - CLI provides intuitive command structure
   - Interactive prompts guide users through complex operations
   - Help documentation covers all commands and scenarios

5. **Performance**
   - All operations meet defined response time requirements
   - Memory usage remains within acceptable limits
   - System handles large rule sets efficiently

## Implementation Roadmap

1. **Phase 1: Core Infrastructure**
   - CLI command parsing framework
   - Workflow and mode data structures
   - Basic file system operations

2. **Phase 2: Workflow Management**
   - Workflow CRUD operations
   - Workflow configuration handling
   - Workflow validation

3. **Phase 3: Mode Operations**
   - Mode selection and configuration
   - Cross-workflow mode handling
   - Mode-specific settings

4. **Phase 4: Rules Engine**
   - Rule copying and transformation
   - Validation and conflict resolution
   - Rule format handling

5. **Phase 5: User Experience**
   - Interactive command prompts
   - Help documentation
   - Error handling improvements
   - Terminal UI enhancements

## Security Considerations

1. **File Access Controls**: Restrict operations to authorized directories
2. **Input Validation**: Sanitize all user inputs to prevent injection attacks
3. **Dependency Management**: Regularly audit and update dependencies
4. **Configuration Security**: Protect sensitive configuration with appropriate permissions
5. **Execution Context**: Validate execution environment before performing privileged operations

## Glossary

- **Workflow**: A collection of related modes and configurations for a specific development scenario
- **Mode**: A specific operational state within a workflow with defined behaviors and rules
- **Definition**: A structured specification of behavior, typically in JSON or YAML format
- **Rule**: A guideline or constraint that governs behavior within a mode
- **Transform**: The process of converting rules between different formats or schemas
- **Interactive Prompt**: A CLI interface element that guides users through available options

## Conclusion

This specification provides a comprehensive blueprint for implementing a robust, user-friendly Node.js CLI tool for workflow and mode management. The modular architecture enables incremental development and testing, with clear interfaces between components. By following the defined requirements and constraints, the implementation will deliver a valuable tool that enhances developer productivity and workflow management.
