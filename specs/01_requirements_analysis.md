# Roo Init CLI Tool - Requirements Analysis

## Project Overview

The Roo Init CLI tool is designed to initialize projects with specific workflows, modes, and rules. It allows users to select a workflow (e.g., SPARC, BMAD), choose specific modes within that workflow, and copy the necessary mode definitions and rules to the target project.

## Functional Requirements

### 1. Workflow Selection

- **FR1.1**: The CLI must allow users to select a "workflow" (e.g., SPARC, BMAD).
- **FR1.2**: Each workflow must define a set of available modes and rules.
- **FR1.3**: The CLI must provide a list of available workflows for the user to choose from.
- **FR1.4**: The CLI must validate that the selected workflow exists.

### 2. Mode Selection

- **FR2.1**: For a selected workflow, the CLI must allow users to select specific "modes" to include in their project.
- **FR2.2**: Some core modes (e.g., orchestrator, spec-writer, auto-coder for SPARC) should be pre-selected or recommended.
- **FR2.3**: The CLI must provide a list of available modes for the selected workflow.
- **FR2.4**: The CLI must validate that the selected modes exist within the workflow.
- **FR2.5**: The CLI must allow users to select multiple modes.

### 3. Mode Definition Copying

- **FR3.1**: The CLI must copy the selected modes' definitions to the target project.
- **FR3.2**: The mode definitions must be in JSON format, similar to the provided `.roomodes` content.
- **FR3.3**: The CLI must create a `.roomodes` file in the target project if it doesn't exist.
- **FR3.4**: The CLI must update the `.roomodes` file in the target project if it already exists.

### 4. Rule Copying

- **FR4.1**: The CLI must copy the associated rules for the selected modes into the target project's `.roo` directory.
- **FR4.2**: Mode-specific rules must be located at `[source_rules_path]/rules-[mode_slug]/*.md`.
- **FR4.3**: Generic rules for the workflow must be located at `[source_rules_path]/rules/*.md`.
- **FR4.4**: The CLI must create the `.roo` directory and subdirectories in the target project if they don't exist.
- **FR4.5**: The CLI must preserve the directory structure of the rules when copying.

### 5. Extensibility

- **FR5.1**: The CLI must be extensible to support new workflows, modes, and rule structures in the future.
- **FR5.2**: The CLI must use a configuration file or mechanism to define workflows, their modes, and rule locations.
- **FR5.3**: The CLI must allow for the addition of new workflows without modifying the core code.
- **FR5.4**: The CLI must allow for the addition of new modes to existing workflows without modifying the core code.

### 6. CLI Interface

- **FR6.1**: The CLI must provide a clear command structure (e.g., `roo-init <command> [options]`).
- **FR6.2**: The CLI must provide help text and usage examples.
- **FR6.3**: The CLI must provide feedback on the progress and success/failure of operations.
- **FR6.4**: The CLI must support both interactive and non-interactive modes.

## Edge Cases and Error Handling

### Workflow Selection

- **EC1.1**: No workflows are available.
- **EC1.2**: Invalid workflow name provided.
- **EC1.3**: Workflow configuration is malformed or incomplete.

### Mode Selection

- **EC2.1**: No modes are available for the selected workflow.
- **EC2.2**: Invalid mode name provided.
- **EC2.3**: Conflicting modes selected.
- **EC2.4**: User deselects a core/required mode.

### File Operations

- **EC3.1**: Target directory doesn't exist.
- **EC3.2**: Target directory is not writable.
- **EC3.3**: `.roomodes` file already exists in the target project.
- **EC3.4**: `.roo` directory already exists in the target project.
- **EC3.5**: Source files or directories don't exist.
- **EC3.6**: Source files or directories are not readable.
- **EC3.7**: Insufficient disk space for copying files.
- **EC3.8**: File system errors during copying.

### Configuration

- **EC4.1**: Configuration file is missing.
- **EC4.2**: Configuration file is malformed or invalid.
- **EC4.3**: Referenced paths in configuration don't exist.

## Constraints

### Technical Constraints

- **TC1.1**: The CLI must be implemented in Node.js.
- **TC1.2**: The CLI must be compatible with Node.js version 14.x and above.
- **TC1.3**: The CLI must be cross-platform (Windows, macOS, Linux).
- **TC1.4**: The CLI must have minimal dependencies to ensure easy installation and maintenance.

### Performance Constraints

- **PC1.1**: The CLI must complete initialization within a reasonable time frame (< 30 seconds for typical projects).
- **PC1.2**: The CLI must handle large workflows with many modes and rules efficiently.
- **PC1.3**: The CLI must minimize memory usage during operation.

### Security Constraints

- **SC1.1**: The CLI must not modify files outside the target project directory without explicit permission.
- **SC1.2**: The CLI must validate all user inputs to prevent injection attacks.
- **SC1.3**: The CLI must not include sensitive information in logs or error messages.

## Non-Functional Requirements

### Usability

- **NFR1.1**: The CLI must provide clear and concise error messages.
- **NFR1.2**: The CLI must provide progress indicators for long-running operations.
- **NFR1.3**: The CLI must provide a consistent and intuitive command structure.
- **NFR1.4**: The CLI must provide helpful documentation and examples.

### Maintainability

- **NFR2.1**: The CLI code must be modular and well-documented.
- **NFR2.2**: The CLI must use a consistent coding style and follow best practices.
- **NFR2.3**: The CLI must include comprehensive tests.
- **NFR2.4**: The CLI must be designed for easy extension and modification.

### Reliability

- **NFR3.1**: The CLI must handle errors gracefully and provide meaningful error messages.
- **NFR3.2**: The CLI must validate inputs and configurations before performing operations.
- **NFR3.3**: The CLI must ensure data integrity during file operations.
- **NFR3.4**: The CLI must provide a way to rollback changes in case of failure.
